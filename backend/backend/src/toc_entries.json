A character\nwho reaches a specified experience point total advances in\ncapability. This advancement is called gaining a level.\nWhen your character gains a level, his or her class often grants\nadditional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of\nthese features allow you to increase your ability scores, either\nincreasing two scores by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You\ncan’t increase an ability score above 20. In addition, every\ncharacter’s proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.\nEach time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that\nHit Die, add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the\ntotal to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the\nfixed value shown in your class entry, which is the average result\nof the die roll (rounded up).\nWhen your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point\nmaximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained. For\nexample, if your 7th level fighter has a Constitution score of 18,\nwhen he reaches 8th level, he increases his Constitution score from\n17 to 18, thus increasing his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4.\nHis hit point maximum then increases by 8.\nThe Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to\nadvance in levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency\nbonus for a character of that level. Consult the information in your\ncharacter’s class description to see what other improvements you\ngain at each level.\nCharacter Advancement\nExperience Points\nLevel\nProf. Bonus\n0\n1\n+2\n300\n2\n+2\n900\n3\n+2\n2,700\n4\n+2\n6,500\n5\n+3\n14,000\n6\n+3\n23,000\n7\n+3\n34,000\n8\n+3\n48,000\n9\n+4\n64,000\n10\n+4\n85,000\n11\n+4\n100,000\n12\n+4\n120,000\n13\n+5\n140,000\n14\n+5\n165,000\n15\n+5\n195,000\n16\n+5\n225,000\n17\n+6\n265,000\n18\n+6\n305,000\n19\n+6\n355,000\n20\n+6"

This information\ncan help you decide how old your character is at the start of the\ngame. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide\nan explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you\nplay a young or very old character, your age could explain a\nparticularly low Strength or Constitution score, while advanced age\ncould account for a high Intelligence or Wisdom.\nAlignment\nMost races have tendencies toward certain alignments, described in this entry. These are not binding for player characters, but considering why your dwarf is chaotic, for example, in defiance of lawful dwarf society can help you better define your character.\nSize\nCharacters of most races are Medium, a size category including creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in Equipment.\nSpeed\nYour speed determines how far you can move when traveling (Adventuring) and fighting (Combat).\nLanguages\nBy virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write certain languages.\nSubraces\nSome races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of\nthe parent race in addition to the traits specified for their\nsubrace. Relationships among subraces vary significantly from race\nto race and world to world."

An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.\nAlignment.

Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar.  Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.\nHigh Elf\nAs a high elf, you have a keen mind and a mastery of at least the basics of magic. In many fantasy gaming worlds, there are two kinds of high elves. One type is haughty and reclusive, believing themselves to be superior to non elves and even other elves.

Thanks to your orc blood, you have superior vision in dark and dim conditions. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nMenacing. You gain proficiency in the Intimidation skill.\nRelentless Endurance. When you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.\nSavage Attacks. When you score a critical hit with a melee weapon attack, you can roll one of the weapon’s damage dice one additional time and add it to the extra damage of the critical hit.\nLanguages.

On your turn, you can\nenter a rage as a bonus action.\nWhile raging, you gain the following benefits if you aren’t wearing\nheavy armor:\nYou have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving\nthrows.\nWhen you make a melee weapon attack using Strength, you gain a\nbonus to the damage roll that increases as you gain levels as a\nbarbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian\ntable.\nYou have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\nIf you are able to cast spells, you can’t cast them or concentrate\non them while raging.\nYour rage lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or if your turn ends and you haven’t attacked a hostile creature since your last turn or taken damage since then. You can also end your rage on your turn as a bonus action.\nOnce you have raged the number of times shown for your barbarian\nlevel in the Rages column of the Barbarian table, you must finish a\nlong rest before you can\nrage again.\nUnarmored Defense\nWhile you are not wearing any armor, your Armor Class equals 10 +\nyour Dexterity modifier + your Constitution modifier. You can use a\nshield and still gain this benefit.\nReckless Attack\nStarting at 2nd level, you can throw aside all concern for defense\nto attack with fierce desperation. When you make your first attack\non your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives\nyou advantage on melee weapon attack rolls using Strength during\nthis turn, but attack rolls against you have advantage until your\nnext turn.\nDanger Sense\nAt 2nd level, you gain an uncanny sense of when things nearby aren’t\nas they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge away from\ndanger.\nYou have advantage on Dexterity saving throws against effects that you can see, such as traps and spells. To gain this benefit, you can’t be blinded, deafened, or incapacitated.\nPrimal Path\nAt 3rd level, you choose a path that shapes the nature of your rage.\nChoose the Path of the\nBerserker or the Path of the Totem Warrior, both detailed at the\nend of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd\nlevel and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th levels.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nFast Movement\nStarting at 5th level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you\naren’t wearing heavy armor.\nFeral Instinct\nBy 7th level, your instincts are so honed that you have advantage on\ninitiative rolls.\nAdditionally, if you are surprised at the beginning of combat and aren’t incapacitated, you can act normally on your first turn, but only if you enter your rage before doing anything else on that turn.\nBrutal Critical\nBeginning at 9th level, you can roll one additional weapon damage\ndie when determining the extra damage for a critical hit with a\nmelee attack.\nThis increases to two additional dice at 13th level and three\nadditional dice at 17th level.\nRelentless Rage\nStarting at 11th level, your rage can keep you fighting despite\ngrievous wounds. If you drop to 0 hit points while you’re raging and\ndon’t die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw.\nIf you succeed, you drop to 1 hit point instead.\nEach time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by\n5. When you finish a short\nor long rest, the DC resets\nto 10.\nPersistent Rage\nBeginning at 15th level, your rage is so fierce that it ends early\nonly if you fall unconscious or if you choose to end it.\nIndomitable Might\nBeginning at 18th level, if your total for a Strength check is less\nthan your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the\ntotal.\nPrimal Champion\nAt 20th level, you embody the power of the wilds. Your Strength and\nConstitution scores increase by 4. Your maximum for those scores is\nnow 24.\nPrimal Paths\nPath of the Berserker\nFor some barbarians, rage is a means to an end—that end being\nviolence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury,\nslick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in\nthe chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well being.\nFrenzy\nStarting when you choose this path at 3rd level, you can go into a\nfrenzy when you rage. If you do so, for the duration of your rage\nyou can make a single melee weapon attack as a bonus action on each\nof your turns after this one. When your rage ends, you suffer one\nlevel of exhaustion (as\ndescribed in appendix A).\nMindless Rage\nBeginning at 6th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened while raging. If you are charmed or frightened when you enter your rage, the effect is suspended for the duration of the rage.\nIntimidating Presence\nBeginning at 10th level, you can use your action to frighten someone with your menacing presence. When you do so, choose one creature that you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to extend the duration of this effect on the frightened creature until the end of your next turn. This effect ends if the creature ends its turn out of line of sight or more than 60 feet away from you.\nIf the creature succeeds on its saving throw, you can’t use this\nfeature on that creature again for 24 hours.\nRetaliation\nStarting at 14th level, when you take damage from a creature that is\nwithin 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to make a melee\nweapon attack against that creature."

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.\nCantrips\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.\nSpell Slots\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st level spell cure wounds and have a 1st level and a 2nd level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know four 1st level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, Equipment) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nBardic Inspiration\nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nJack of All Trades\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nBard College\nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.\nExpertise\nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nFont of Inspiration\nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.\nCountercharm\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn.  During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.  The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).\nMagical Secrets\nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.\nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.\nYou learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.\nSuperior Inspiration\nAt 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.\nBard Colleges\nCollege of Lore\nBards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\nThe college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self important figures of authority.\nBonus Proficiencies\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\nCutting Words\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.  When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.\nAdditional Magical Secrets\nAt 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.\nPeerless Skill\nStarting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail."

Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nJack of All Trades\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nBard College\nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.\nExpertise\nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nFont of Inspiration\nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.\nCountercharm\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind influencing effects. As an action, you can start a performance that lasts until the end of your next turn.  During that time, you and any friendly creatures within 30 feet of you have advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed. A creature must be able to hear you to gain this benefit.  The performance ends early if you are incapacitated or silenced or if you voluntarily end it (no action required).\nMagical Secrets\nBy 10th level, you have plundered magical knowledge from a wide spectrum of disciplines. Choose two spells from any class, including this one. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip.\nThe chosen spells count as bard spells for you and are included in the number in the Spells Known column of the Bard table.\nYou learn two additional spells from any class at 14th level and again at 18th level.\nSuperior Inspiration\nAt 20th level, when you roll initiative and have no uses of Bardic Inspiration left, you regain one use.\nBard Colleges\nCollege of Lore\nBards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.\nThe loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.\nThe college’s members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self important figures of authority.\nBonus Proficiencies\nWhen you join the College of Lore at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with three skills of your choice.\nCutting Words\nAlso at 3rd level, you learn how to use your wit to distract, confuse, and otherwise sap the confidence and competence of others.  When a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a damage roll, you can use your reaction to expend one of your uses of Bardic Inspiration, rolling a Bardic Inspiration die and subtracting the number rolled from the creature’s roll. You can choose to use this feature after the creature makes its roll, but before the GM determines whether the attack roll or ability check succeeds or fails, or before the creature deals its damage. The creature is immune if it can’t hear you or if it’s immune to being charmed.\nAdditional Magical Secrets\nAt 6th level, you learn two spells of your choice from any class. A spell you choose must be of a level you can cast, as shown on the Bard table, or a cantrip. The chosen spells count as bard spells for you but don’t count against the number of bard spells you know.\nPeerless Skill\nStarting at 14th level, when you make an ability check, you can expend one use of Bardic Inspiration. Roll a Bardic Inspiration die and add the number rolled to your ability check. You can choose to do so after you roll the die for the ability check, but before the GM tells you whether you succeed or fail."

Your spells are part of your vast repertoire, magic that you can tune to different situations.\nCantrips\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the bard spell list. You learn additional bard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bard table.\nSpell Slots\nThe Bard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st level spell cure wounds and have a 1st level and a 2nd level spell slot available, you can cast cure wounds using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know four 1st level spells of your choice from the bard spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Bard table shows when you learn more bard spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the table. For instance, when you reach 3rd level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the bard spells you know and replace it with another spell from the bard spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your bard spells. Your magic comes from the heart and soul you pour into the performance of your music or oration. You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast any bard spell you know as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a musical instrument (see chapter 5, Equipment) as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells.\nBardic Inspiration\nYou can inspire others through stirring words or music. To do so, you use a bonus action on your turn to choose one creature other than yourself within 60 feet of you who can hear you. That creature gains one Bardic Inspiration die, a d6.\nOnce within the next 10 minutes, the creature can roll the die and add the number rolled to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The creature can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to use the Bardic Inspiration die, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once the Bardic Inspiration die is rolled, it is lost. A creature can have only one Bardic Inspiration die at a time.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a long rest.\nYour Bardic Inspiration die changes when you reach certain levels in this class. The die becomes a d8 at 5th level, a d10 at 10th level, and a d12 at 15th level.\nJack of All Trades\nStarting at 2nd level, you can add half your proficiency bonus, rounded down, to any ability check you make that doesn’t already include your proficiency bonus.\nSong of Rest\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can use soothing music or oration to help revitalize your wounded allies during a short rest. If you or any friendly creatures who can hear your performance regain hit points at the end of the short rest by spending one or more Hit Dice, each of those creatures regains an extra 1d6 hit points.\nThe extra hit points increase when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.\nBard College\nAt 3rd level, you delve into the advanced techniques of a bard college of your choice: the College of Lore or the College of Valor, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th and 14th level.\nExpertise\nAt 3rd level, choose two of your skill proficiencies. Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses either of the chosen proficiencies.\nAt 10th level, you can choose another two skill proficiencies to gain this benefit.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nFont of Inspiration\nBeginning when you reach 5th level, you regain all of your expended uses of Bardic Inspiration when you finish a short or long rest.\nCountercharm\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to use musical notes or words of power to disrupt mind influencing effects.

You learn\nadditional cleric cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown\nin the Cantrips Known column of the Cleric table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Cleric table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your\nspells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you\nmust expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all\nexpended spell slots when you finish a\nlong rest.\nYou prepare the list of cleric spells that are available for you to\ncast, choosing from the cleric\nspell list. When you do so, choose a number of cleric spells\nequal to your Wisdom modifier + your cleric level (minimum of one\nspell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell\nslots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level cleric, you have four 1st-level\nand two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of\nprepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any\ncombination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell\ncure wounds, you\ncan cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell\ndoesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a\nlong rest. Preparing a new\nlist of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:\nat least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The\npower of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use\nyour Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting\nability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the\nsaving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an\nattack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual\ntag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a holy symbol\n(see chapter 5, Equipment) as a\nspellcasting focus for your cleric spells.\nDivine Domain\nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,\nLife, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery,\nor War. Each domain is detailed at the end of the class description,\nand each one provides examples of gods associated with it. Your\nchoice grants you domain spells and other features when you choose\nit at 1st level. It also grants you additional ways to use Channel\nDivinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional\nbenefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.\nDomain Spells\nEach domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that\nyou gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once\nyou gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t\ncount against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell\nlist, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.\nChannel Divinity\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly\nfrom your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You\nstart with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by\nyour domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you\nadvance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to\ncreate. You must then finish a\nshort or\nlong rest to use your\nChannel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use\nsuch an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save\nDC.\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice\nbetween rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three\ntimes between rests. When you finish a\nshort or\nlong rest, you regain your\nexpended uses.\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead. Each undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nDestroy Undead\nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against\nyour Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its\nchallenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the\nDestroy Undead table.\nDestroy Undead\nCleric Level\nDestroys Undead of CR…\n5th\n½ or lower\n8th\n1 or lower\n11th\n2 or lower\n14th\n3 or lower\n17th\n4 or lower\nDivine Intervention\nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on\nyour behalf when your need is great.\nImploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe\nthe assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a\nnumber equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity\nintervenes.

Preparing a new\nlist of cleric spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:\nat least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your cleric spells. The\npower of your spells comes from your devotion to your deity. You use\nyour Wisdom whenever a cleric spell refers to your spellcasting\nability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the\nsaving throw DC for a cleric spell you cast and when making an\nattack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a cleric spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual\ntag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a holy symbol\n(see chapter 5, Equipment) as a\nspellcasting focus for your cleric spells.\nDivine Domain\nChoose one domain related to your deity: Knowledge,\nLife, Light, Nature, Tempest, Trickery,\nor War.

It also grants you additional ways to use Channel\nDivinity when you gain that feature at 2nd level, and additional\nbenefits at 6th, 8th, and 17th levels.\nDomain Spells\nEach domain has a list of spells—its domain spells—that\nyou gain at the cleric levels noted in the domain description. Once\nyou gain a domain spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t\ncount against the number of spells you can prepare each day.\nIf you have a domain spell that doesn’t appear on the cleric spell\nlist, the spell is nonetheless a cleric spell for you.\nChannel Divinity\nAt 2nd level, you gain the ability to channel divine energy directly\nfrom your deity, using that energy to fuel magical effects. You\nstart with two such effects: Turn Undead and an effect determined by\nyour domain. Some domains grant you additional effects as you\nadvance in levels, as noted in the domain description.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which effect to\ncreate. You must then finish a\nshort or\nlong rest to use your\nChannel Divinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use\nsuch an effect from this class, the DC equals your cleric spell save\nDC.\nBeginning at 6th level, you can use your Channel Divinity twice\nbetween rests, and beginning at 18th level, you can use it three\ntimes between rests. When you finish a\nshort or\nlong rest, you regain your\nexpended uses.\nChannel Divinity: Turn Undead\nAs an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring the undead.

It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nDestroy Undead\nStarting at 5th level, when an undead fails its saving throw against\nyour Turn Undead feature, the creature is instantly destroyed if its\nchallenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown in the\nDestroy Undead table.\nDestroy Undead\nCleric Level\nDestroys Undead of CR…\n5th\n½ or lower\n8th\n1 or lower\n11th\n2 or lower\n14th\n3 or lower\n17th\n4 or lower\nDivine Intervention\nBeginning at 10th level, you can call on your deity to intervene on\nyour behalf when your need is great.\nImploring your deity’s aid requires you to use your action. Describe\nthe assistance you seek, and roll percentile dice. If you roll a\nnumber equal to or lower than your cleric level, your deity\nintervenes. The GM chooses the nature of the intervention; the\neffect of any cleric spell or cleric domain spell would be\nappropriate.\nIf your deity intervenes, you can’t use this feature again for 7\ndays.

When you reach 14th level,\nthe extra damage increases to 2d8.\nSupreme Healing\nStarting at 17th level, when you would normally roll one or more\ndice to restore hit points with a spell, you instead use the highest\nnumber possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6\nhit points to a creature, you restore 12."

You can speak the\nlanguage and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who\nknow this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot\nthe message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)\ncheck but can’t decipher it without magic.\nSpellcasting\nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells\nto shape that essence to your will.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the\ndruid spell list. You learn\nadditional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown\nin the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your\nspells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,\nyou must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain\nall expended spell slots when you finish a\nlong rest.\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to\ncast, choosing from the druid\nspell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells\nequal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one\nspell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level\nand two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of\nprepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any\ncombination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell\ncure wounds, you\ncan cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell\ndoesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a\nlong rest. Preparing a new\nlist of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:\nat least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since\nyour magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You\nuse your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting\nability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the\nsaving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack\nroll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual\ntag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a druidic\nfocus (see chapter 5,\nEquipment) as a spellcasting\nfocus for your druid spells.\nWild Shape\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume\nthe shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this\nfeature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a\nshort or\nlong rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as\nshown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can\ntransform into any beast that has a challenge rating of ¼ or\nlower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.\nBeast Shapes\nLevel\nCR\nLimitations\nExample\n2nd\n¼\nNo flying or swimming speed\nWolf\n4th\n½\nNo flying speed\nCrocodile\n8th\n1\n—\nGiant eagle\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half\nyour druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form\nunless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to\nyour normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You\nautomatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points,\nor die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast,\nbut you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence,\nWisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and\nsaving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the\ncreature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the\nbonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s\nbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair\nactions, you can’t use them.\nWhen you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit\nDice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the\nnumber of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if\nyou revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess\ndamage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take\n10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you\nrevert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t\nreduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked\nunconscious.\nYou can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any\naction that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your\nbeast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a\nspell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking\nactions that are part of a spell, such as\ncall\nlightning, that you’ve already cast.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or\nother source and can use them if the new form is physically\ncapable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special\nsenses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that\nsense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your\nspace, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment\nfunctions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical\nfor the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the\ncreature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or\nshape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form\ncan’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.\nEquipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave\nthe form.\nDruid Circle\nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the\nCircle of the Land or the Circle\nof the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your\nchoice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and\n14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nTimeless Body\nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you\nto age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages\nonly 1 year.\nBeast Spells\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in\nany shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic\nand verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but\nyou aren’t able to provide material components.\nArchdruid\nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of\ntimes.\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of\nyour druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a\ncost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both\nyour normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\nSacred Plants and Wood\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,\nbirch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow,\nand yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting\nfocus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as\nweapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so\nweapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it.\nAsh is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make\nexcellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as\nwell as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used\nfor thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen\nother plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a\ndesert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\nDruids and the Gods\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most\ndruids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in\nthe multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix\nB include many such deities). The worship of these deities is\noften considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics\nand urbanized peoples.\nDruid Circles\nCircle of the Land\nThe Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard\nancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These\ndruids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to\nwhisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members\npreside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old\nFaith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member\nof this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were\ninitiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.\nBonus Cantrip\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional\ndruid cantrip of your choice.\nNatural Recovery\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by\nsitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a\nshort rest, you choose\nexpended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined\nlevel that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded\nup), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use\nthis feature again until you finish a\nlong rest.\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to\ntwo levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level\nslot or two 1st-level slots.\nCircle Spells\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to\ncast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access\nto circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid.\nChoose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland,\nmountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared,\nand it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare\neach day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the\ndruid spell list, the spell\nis nonetheless a druid spell for you.\nArctic\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nhold person,\nspike growth\n5th\nsleet storm,\nslow\n7th\nfreedom of movement,\nice storm\n9th\ncommune with nature,\ncone of cold\nCoast\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nmirror image,\nmisty step\n5th\nwater breathing,\nwater walk\n7th\ncontrol water,\nfreedom of movement\n9th\nconjure elemental,\nscrying\nDesert\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nblur,\nsilence\n5th\ncreate food and water,\nprotection from energy\n7th\nblight,\nhallucinatory terrain\n9th\ninsect plague,\nwall of stone\nForest\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nbarkskin,\nspider climb\n5th\ncall lightning,\nplant growth\n7th\ndivination,\nfreedom of movement\n9th\ncommune with nature,\ntree stride\nGrassland\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\ninvisibility,\npass without trace\n5th\ndaylight,\nhaste\n7th\ndivination,\nfreedom of movement\n9th\ndream,\ninsect plague\nMountain\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nspider climb,\nspike growth\n5th\nlightning bolt,\nmeld into stone\n7th\nstone shape,\nstoneskin\n9th\npasswall,\nwall of stone\nSwamp\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nacid arrow,\ndarkness\n5th\nwater walk,\nstinking cloud\n7th\nfreedom of movement,\nlocate creature\n9th\ninsect plague,\nscrying\nLand’s Stride\nStarting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain\ncosts you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical\nplants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from\nthem if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that\nare magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those\ncreated by the\nentangle spell.\nNature’s Ward\nWhen you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by\nelementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.\nNature’s Sanctuary\nWhen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your\nconnection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast\nor plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom\nsaving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the\ncreature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically\nmisses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect\nfor 24 hours.\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack\nagainst you."

You can perform the somatic\nand verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but\nyou aren’t able to provide material components.\nArchdruid\nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of\ntimes.\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of\nyour druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a\ncost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both\nyour normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\nSacred Plants and Wood\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,\nbirch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow,\nand yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting\nfocus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as\nweapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so\nweapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it.\nAsh is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make\nexcellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as\nwell as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used\nfor thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen\nother plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a\ndesert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\nDruids and the Gods\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most\ndruids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in\nthe multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix\nB include many such deities). The worship of these deities is\noften considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics\nand urbanized peoples.\nDruid Circles\nCircle of the Land\nThe Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard\nancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These\ndruids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to\nwhisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members\npreside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old\nFaith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member\nof this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were\ninitiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.\nBonus Cantrip\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional\ndruid cantrip of your choice.\nNatural Recovery\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by\nsitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a\nshort rest, you choose\nexpended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined\nlevel that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded\nup), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use\nthis feature again until you finish a\nlong rest.\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to\ntwo levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level\nslot or two 1st-level slots.\nCircle Spells\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to\ncast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access\nto circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid.\nChoose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland,\nmountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared,\nand it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare\neach day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn’t appear on the\ndruid spell list, the spell\nis nonetheless a druid spell for you.\nArctic\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nhold person,\nspike growth\n5th\nsleet storm,\nslow\n7th\nfreedom of movement,\nice storm\n9th\ncommune with nature,\ncone of cold\nCoast\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nmirror image,\nmisty step\n5th\nwater breathing,\nwater walk\n7th\ncontrol water,\nfreedom of movement\n9th\nconjure elemental,\nscrying\nDesert\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nblur,\nsilence\n5th\ncreate food and water,\nprotection from energy\n7th\nblight,\nhallucinatory terrain\n9th\ninsect plague,\nwall of stone\nForest\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nbarkskin,\nspider climb\n5th\ncall lightning,\nplant growth\n7th\ndivination,\nfreedom of movement\n9th\ncommune with nature,\ntree stride\nGrassland\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\ninvisibility,\npass without trace\n5th\ndaylight,\nhaste\n7th\ndivination,\nfreedom of movement\n9th\ndream,\ninsect plague\nMountain\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nspider climb,\nspike growth\n5th\nlightning bolt,\nmeld into stone\n7th\nstone shape,\nstoneskin\n9th\npasswall,\nwall of stone\nSwamp\nDruid Level\nCircle Spells\n3rd\nacid arrow,\ndarkness\n5th\nwater walk,\nstinking cloud\n7th\nfreedom of movement,\nlocate creature\n9th\ninsect plague,\nscrying\nLand’s Stride\nStarting at 6th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain\ncosts you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical\nplants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from\nthem if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that\nare magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those\ncreated by the\nentangle spell.\nNature’s Ward\nWhen you reach 10th level, you can’t be charmed or frightened by\nelementals or fey, and you are immune to poison and disease.\nNature’s Sanctuary\nWhen you reach 14th level, creatures of the natural world sense your\nconnection to nature and become hesitant to attack you. When a beast\nor plant creature attacks you, that creature must make a Wisdom\nsaving throw against your druid spell save DC. On a failed save, the\ncreature must choose a different target, or the attack automatically\nmisses. On a successful save, the creature is immune to this effect\nfor 24 hours.\nThe creature is aware of this effect before it makes its attack\nagainst you."

You can speak the\nlanguage and use it to leave hidden messages. You and others who\nknow this language automatically spot such a message. Others spot\nthe message’s presence with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception)\ncheck but can’t decipher it without magic.\nSpellcasting\nDrawing on the divine essence of nature itself, you can cast spells\nto shape that essence to your will.\nCantrips\nAt 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the\ndruid spell list. You learn\nadditional druid cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown\nin the Cantrips Known column of the Druid table.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Druid table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your\nspells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these druid spells,\nyou must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain\nall expended spell slots when you finish a\nlong rest.\nYou prepare the list of druid spells that are available for you to\ncast, choosing from the druid\nspell list. When you do so, choose a number of druid spells\nequal to your Wisdom modifier + your druid level (minimum of one\nspell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 3rd-level druid, you have four 1st-level\nand two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Wisdom of 16, your list of\nprepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any\ncombination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell\ncure wounds, you\ncan cast it using a 1st-level or 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell\ndoesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can also change your list of prepared spells when you finish a\nlong rest. Preparing a new\nlist of druid spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation:\nat least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your druid spells, since\nyour magic draws upon your devotion and attunement to nature. You\nuse your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting\nability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the\nsaving throw DC for a druid spell you cast and when making an attack\nroll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a druid spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual\ntag and you have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a druidic\nfocus (see chapter 5,\nEquipment) as a spellcasting\nfocus for your druid spells.\nWild Shape\nStarting at 2nd level, you can use your action to magically assume\nthe shape of a beast that you have seen before. You can use this\nfeature twice. You regain expended uses when you finish a\nshort or\nlong rest.\nYour druid level determines the beasts you can transform into, as\nshown in the Beast Shapes table. At 2nd level, for example, you can\ntransform into any beast that has a challenge rating of ¼ or\nlower that doesn’t have a flying or swimming speed.\nBeast Shapes\nLevel\nCR\nLimitations\nExample\n2nd\n¼\nNo flying or swimming speed\nWolf\n4th\n½\nNo flying speed\nCrocodile\n8th\n1\n—\nGiant eagle\nYou can stay in a beast shape for a number of hours equal to half\nyour druid level (rounded down). You then revert to your normal form\nunless you expend another use of this feature. You can revert to\nyour normal form earlier by using a bonus action on your turn. You\nautomatically revert if you fall unconscious, drop to 0 hit points,\nor die.\nWhile you are transformed, the following rules apply:\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the beast,\nbut you retain your alignment, personality, and Intelligence,\nWisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and\nsaving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the\ncreature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the\nbonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature’s\nbonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair\nactions, you can’t use them.\nWhen you transform, you assume the beast’s hit points and Hit\nDice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the\nnumber of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if\nyou revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess\ndamage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take\n10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you\nrevert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn’t\nreduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked\nunconscious.\nYou can’t cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any\naction that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your\nbeast form. Transforming doesn’t break your concentration on a\nspell you’ve already cast, however, or prevent you from taking\nactions that are part of a spell, such as\ncall\nlightning, that you’ve already cast.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or\nother source and can use them if the new form is physically\ncapable of doing so. However, you can’t use any of your special\nsenses, such as darkvision, unless your new form also has that\nsense.\nYou choose whether your equipment falls to the ground in your\nspace, merges into your new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment\nfunctions as normal, but the GM decides whether it is practical\nfor the new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the\ncreature’s shape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change size or\nshape to match the new form, and any equipment that the new form\ncan’t wear must either fall to the ground or merge with it.\nEquipment that merges with the form has no effect until you leave\nthe form.\nDruid Circle\nAt 2nd level, you choose to identify with a circle of druids: the\nCircle of the Land or the Circle\nof the Moon, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your\nchoice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and\n14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nTimeless Body\nStarting at 18th level, the primal magic that you wield causes you\nto age more slowly. For every 10 years that pass, your body ages\nonly 1 year.\nBeast Spells\nBeginning at 18th level, you can cast many of your druid spells in\nany shape you assume using Wild Shape. You can perform the somatic\nand verbal components of a druid spell while in a beast shape, but\nyou aren’t able to provide material components.\nArchdruid\nAt 20th level, you can use your Wild Shape an unlimited number of\ntimes.\nAdditionally, you can ignore the verbal and somatic components of\nyour druid spells, as well as any material components that lack a\ncost and aren’t consumed by a spell. You gain this benefit in both\nyour normal shape and your beast shape from Wild Shape.\nSacred Plants and Wood\nA druid holds certain plants to be sacred, particularly alder, ash,\nbirch, elder, hazel, holly, juniper, mistletoe, oak, rowan, willow,\nand yew. Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting\nfocus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.\nSimilarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as\nweapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so\nweapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it.\nAsh is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make\nexcellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as\nwell as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used\nfor thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.\nDruids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen\nother plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a\ndesert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.\nDruids and the Gods\nSome druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most\ndruids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in\nthe multiverse (the lists of gods in appendix\nB include many such deities). The worship of these deities is\noften considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics\nand urbanized peoples.\nDruid Circles\nCircle of the Land\nThe Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard\nancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These\ndruids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to\nwhisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle’s wisest members\npreside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old\nFaith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member\nof this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were\ninitiated into the circle’s mysterious rites.\nBonus Cantrip\nWhen you choose this circle at 2nd level, you learn one additional\ndruid cantrip of your choice.\nNatural Recovery\nStarting at 2nd level, you can regain some of your magical energy by\nsitting in meditation and communing with nature. During a\nshort rest, you choose\nexpended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined\nlevel that is equal to or less than half your druid level (rounded\nup), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. You can’t use\nthis feature again until you finish a\nlong rest.\nFor example, when you are a 4th-level druid, you can recover up to\ntwo levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level\nslot or two 1st-level slots.\nCircle Spells\nYour mystical connection to the land infuses you with the ability to\ncast certain spells. At 3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th level you gain access\nto circle spells connected to the land where you became a druid.\nChoose that land—arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland,\nmountain, or swamp—and consult the associated list of spells.\nOnce you gain access to a circle spell, you always have it prepared,\nand it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare\neach day.

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\nWhen you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.\nKi\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the\nmystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a\nnumber of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points\nyou have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start\nknowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and\nStep of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in\nthis class.\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a\nshort or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your\nexpended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes\nof the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw\nto resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated\nas follows:\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom\nmodifier\nFlurry of Blows\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\nPatient Defense\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\nStep of the Wind\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\nUnarmored Movement\nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are\nnot wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when\nyou reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces\nand across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\nMonastic Tradition\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic\ntradition: the Way of the Open\nHand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all\ndetailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants\nyou features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\nDeflect Missiles\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch\nthe missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do\nso, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your\nDexterity modifier + your monk level.\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is\nsmall enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one\nhand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki\npoint to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition\nyou just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack\nwith proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the\nmissile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal\nrange of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSlow Fall\nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to\nreduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times\nyour monk level.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,\nwhenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nStunning Strike\nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an\nopponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon\nattack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The\ntarget must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned\nuntil the end of your next turn.\nKi-Empowered Strikes\nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the\npurpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks\nand damage.\nEvasion\nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way\nof certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or\na fireball spell.\nWhen you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a\nDexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no\ndamage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if\nyou fail.\nStillness of Mind\nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on\nyourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.\nPurity of Body\nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you\nimmune to disease and poison.\nTongue of the Sun and Moon\nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so\nthat you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature\nthat can understand a language can understand what you say.\nDiamond Soul\nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency\nin all saving throws.\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can\nspend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.\nTimeless Body\nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the\nfrailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still\ndie of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or\nwater.\nEmpty Body\nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki\npoints to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also\nhave resistance to all damage but force damage.\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the\nastral\nprojection spell, without needing material components. When you\ndo so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.\nPerfect Self\nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points\nremaining, you regain 4 ki points.\nMonastic Traditions\nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries\nscattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one\ntradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and\ninstruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest.\nAll three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as\nthe student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition\nonly upon reaching 3rd level.\nWay of the Open Hand\nMonks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of\nmartial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques\nto push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to\ntheir bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them\nfrom harm.\nOpen Hand Technique\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can\nmanipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you\nhit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of\nBlows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\nIt must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\nIt must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it\nup to 15 feet away from you\nIt can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.\nWholeness of Body\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action,\nyou can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You\nmust finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\nTranquility\nBeginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that\nsurrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you\ngain the effect of a\nsanctuary spell\nthat lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end\nearly as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your\nWisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.\nQuivering Palm\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in\nsomeone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you\ncan spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which\nlast for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations\nare harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you\nand the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use\nthis action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If\nit fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes\n10d10 necrotic damage.\nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a\ntime. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using\nan action."

This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.\nWhen you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn.\nCertain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.\nKi\nStarting at 2nd level, your training allows you to harness the\nmystic energy of ki. Your access to this energy is represented by a\nnumber of ki points. Your monk level determines the number of points\nyou have, as shown in the Ki Points column of the Monk table.\nYou can spend these points to fuel various ki features. You start\nknowing three such features: Flurry of Blows, Patient Defense, and\nStep of the Wind. You learn more ki features as you gain levels in\nthis class.\nWhen you spend a ki point, it is unavailable until you finish a\nshort or long rest, at the end of which you draw all of your\nexpended ki back into yourself. You must spend at least 30 minutes\nof the rest meditating to regain your ki points.\nSome of your ki features require your target to make a saving throw\nto resist the feature’s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated\nas follows:\nKi save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom\nmodifier\nFlurry of Blows\nImmediately after you take the Attack action on your turn, you can spend 1 ki point to make two unarmed strikes as a bonus action.\nPatient Defense\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Dodge action as a bonus action on your turn.\nStep of the Wind\nYou can spend 1 ki point to take the Disengage or Dash action as a bonus action on your turn, and your jump distance is doubled for the turn.\nUnarmored Movement\nStarting at 2nd level, your speed increases by 10 feet while you are\nnot wearing armor or wielding a shield. This bonus increases when\nyou reach certain monk levels, as shown in the Monk table.\nAt 9th level, you gain the ability to move along vertical surfaces\nand across liquids on your turn without falling during the move.\nMonastic Tradition\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you commit yourself to a monastic\ntradition: the Way of the Open\nHand, the Way of Shadow, or the Way of the Four Elements, all\ndetailed at the end of the class description. Your tradition grants\nyou features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 11th, and 17th level.\nDeflect Missiles\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use your reaction to deflect or catch\nthe missile when you are hit by a ranged weapon attack. When you do\nso, the damage you take from the attack is reduced by 1d10 + your\nDexterity modifier + your monk level.\nIf you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is\nsmall enough for you to hold in one hand and you have at least one\nhand free. If you catch a missile in this way, you can spend 1 ki\npoint to make a ranged attack with the weapon or piece of ammunition\nyou just caught, as part of the same reaction. You make this attack\nwith proficiency, regardless of your weapon proficiencies, and the\nmissile counts as a monk weapon for the attack, which has a normal\nrange of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSlow Fall\nBeginning at 4th level, you can use your reaction when you fall to\nreduce any falling damage you take by an amount equal to five times\nyour monk level.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once,\nwhenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nStunning Strike\nStarting at 5th level, you can interfere with the flow of ki in an\nopponent’s body. When you hit another creature with a melee weapon\nattack, you can spend 1 ki point to attempt a stunning strike. The\ntarget must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be stunned\nuntil the end of your next turn.\nKi-Empowered Strikes\nStarting at 6th level, your unarmed strikes count as magical for the\npurpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks\nand damage.\nEvasion\nAt 7th level, your instinctive agility lets you dodge out of the way\nof certain area effects, such as a blue dragon’s lightning breath or\na fireball spell.\nWhen you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a\nDexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no\ndamage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if\nyou fail.\nStillness of Mind\nStarting at 7th level, you can use your action to end one effect on\nyourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.\nPurity of Body\nAt 10th level, your mastery of the ki flowing through you makes you\nimmune to disease and poison.\nTongue of the Sun and Moon\nStarting at 13th level, you learn to touch the ki of other minds so\nthat you understand all spoken languages. Moreover, any creature\nthat can understand a language can understand what you say.\nDiamond Soul\nBeginning at 14th level, your mastery of ki grants you proficiency\nin all saving throws.\nAdditionally, whenever you make a saving throw and fail, you can\nspend 1 ki point to reroll it and take the second result.\nTimeless Body\nAt 15th level, your ki sustains you so that you suffer none of the\nfrailty of old age, and you can’t be aged magically. You can still\ndie of old age, however. In addition, you no longer need food or\nwater.\nEmpty Body\nBeginning at 18th level, you can use your action to spend 4 ki\npoints to become invisible for 1 minute. During that time, you also\nhave resistance to all damage but force damage.\nAdditionally, you can spend 8 ki points to cast the\nastral\nprojection spell, without needing material components. When you\ndo so, you can’t take any other creatures with you.\nPerfect Self\nAt 20th level, when you roll for initiative and have no ki points\nremaining, you regain 4 ki points.\nMonastic Traditions\nThree traditions of monastic pursuit are common in the monasteries\nscattered across the multiverse. Most monasteries practice one\ntradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and\ninstruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest.\nAll three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as\nthe student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition\nonly upon reaching 3rd level.\nWay of the Open Hand\nMonks of the Way of the Open Hand are the ultimate masters of\nmartial arts combat, whether armed or unarmed. They learn techniques\nto push and trip their opponents, manipulate ki to heal damage to\ntheir bodies, and practice advanced meditation that can protect them\nfrom harm.\nOpen Hand Technique\nStarting when you choose this tradition at 3rd level, you can\nmanipulate your enemy’s ki when you harness your own. Whenever you\nhit a creature with one of the attacks granted by your Flurry of\nBlows, you can impose one of the following effects on that target:\nIt must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be knocked prone.\nIt must make a Strength saving throw. If it fails, you can push it\nup to 15 feet away from you\nIt can’t take reactions until the end of your next turn.\nWholeness of Body\nAt 6th level, you gain the ability to heal yourself. As an action,\nyou can regain hit points equal to three times your monk level. You\nmust finish a long rest before you can use this feature again.\nTranquility\nBeginning at 11th level, you can enter a special meditation that\nsurrounds you with an aura of peace. At the end of a long rest, you\ngain the effect of a\nsanctuary spell\nthat lasts until the start of your next long rest (the spell can end\nearly as normal). The saving throw DC for the spell equals 8 + your\nWisdom modifier + your proficiency bonus.\nQuivering Palm\nAt 17th level, you gain the ability to set up lethal vibrations in\nsomeone’s body. When you hit a creature with an unarmed strike, you\ncan spend 3 ki points to start these imperceptible vibrations, which\nlast for a number of days equal to your monk level. The vibrations\nare harmless unless you use your action to end them. To do so, you\nand the target must be on the same plane of existence. When you use\nthis action, the creature must make a Constitution saving throw. If\nit fails, it is reduced to 0 hit points. If it succeeds, it takes\n10d10 necrotic damage.\nYou can have only one creature under the effect of this feature at a\ntime. You can choose to end the vibrations harmlessly without using\nan action."

You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being\nwhose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count\nStrahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also\ndetect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated\nor desecrated, as with the\nhallow spell.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your\nCharisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all\nexpended uses.\nLay on Hands\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power\nthat replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can\nrestore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level\n× 5.\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool\nto restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the\nmaximum amount remaining in your pool.\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing\nto cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting\nit. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons\nwith a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately\nfor each one.\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\nFighting Style\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.\nChoose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style\noption more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nDefense\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nDueling\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other\nweapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nGreat Weapon Fighting\nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\nProtection\nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.\nSpellcasting\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through\nmeditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your\nspells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher,\nyou must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain\nall expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to\ncast, choosing from the paladin\nspell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells\nequal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded\ndown (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which\nyou have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level\nand two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of\nprepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any\ncombination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can\ncast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell\ndoesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long\nrest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in\nprayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each\nspell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since\ntheir power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use\nyour Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.\nIn addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving\nthrow DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll\nwith one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma\nmodifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your\nCharisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a holy symbol\nas a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\nDivine Smite\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon\nattack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the\ntarget, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8\nfor a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher\nthan 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the\ntarget is an undead or a fiend.\nDivine Health\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune\nto disease.\nSacred Oath\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a\npaladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory\nstage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose\nthe Oath of Devotion, the Oath of\nthe Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of\nthe class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th,\nand 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel\nDivinity feature.\nOath Spells\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these\nspells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you\ngain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath\nspells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each\nday.\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell\nlist, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\nChannel Divinity\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical\neffects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains\nhow to use it.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use.\nYou must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel\nDivinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use\nsuch an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell\nsave DC.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nAura of Protection\nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10\nfeet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to\nthe saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum\nbonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nAura of Courage\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of\nyou can’t be frightened while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nImproved Divine Smite\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.\nCleansing Touch\nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on\nyourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma\nmodifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you\nfinish a long rest.\nSacred Oaths\nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to\nthe cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness.\nThe final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the\nculmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this\nclass don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have\nreached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual\nswearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has\nalways been true in the paladin’s heart.\nBreaking Your Oath\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but\neven the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path\nproves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of\ntwo evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to\ntransgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a\ncleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the\nsame order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as\na sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of\nselfbdenial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin\nstarts fresh.\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of\nrepentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s\ndiscretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this\nclass and adopt another.\nOath of Devotion\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\nHonesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\nCourage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.\nCompassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.\nHonor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.\nDuty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\nOath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\nOath of Devotion Spells\nPaladin Level\nSpells\n3rd\nprotection from evil and good,\nsanctuary\n5th\nlesser restoration,\nzone of truth\n9th\nbeacon of hope,\ndispel magic\n13th\nfreedom of movement,\nguardian of faith\n17th\ncommune,\nflame strike\nChannel Divinity\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\nSacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity.  For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that.  If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\nTurn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAura of Devotion\nStarting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of\nyou can’t be charmed while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nPurity of Spirit\nBeginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\nHoly Nimbus\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight.\nFor 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and\ndim light shines 30 feet beyond that.\nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the\ncreature takes 10 radiant damage.\nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws\nagainst spells cast by fiends or undead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a\nlong rest."

As\nan action, you can open your awareness to detect such forces. Until\nthe end of your next turn, you know the location of any celestial,\nfiend, or undead within 60 feet of you that is not behind total\ncover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being\nwhose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count\nStrahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you also\ndetect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated\nor desecrated, as with the\nhallow spell.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your\nCharisma modifier. When you finish a long rest, you regain all\nexpended uses.\nLay on Hands\nYour blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power\nthat replenishes when you take a long rest. With that pool, you can\nrestore a total number of hit points equal to your paladin level\n× 5.\nAs an action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool\nto restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the\nmaximum amount remaining in your pool.\nAlternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing\nto cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting\nit. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons\nwith a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately\nfor each one.\nThis feature has no effect on undead and constructs.\nFighting Style\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a style of fighting as your specialty.\nChoose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style\noption more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nDefense\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nDueling\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other\nweapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nGreat Weapon Fighting\nWhen you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.\nProtection\nWhen a creature you can see attacks a target other than you that is within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll. You must be wielding a shield.\nSpellcasting\nBy 2nd level, you have learned to draw on divine magic through\nmeditation and prayer to cast spells as a cleric does.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Paladin table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your\nspells. To cast one of your paladin spells of 1st level or higher,\nyou must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain\nall expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of paladin spells that are available for you to\ncast, choosing from the paladin\nspell list. When you do so, choose a number of paladin spells\nequal to your Charisma modifier + half your paladin level, rounded\ndown (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which\nyou have spell slots.\nFor example, if you are a 5th-level paladin, you have four 1st-level\nand two 2nd-level spell slots. With a Charisma of 14, your list of\nprepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any\ncombination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can\ncast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell\ndoesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long\nrest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in\nprayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each\nspell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your paladin spells, since\ntheir power derives from the strength of your convictions. You use\nyour Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.\nIn addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving\nthrow DC for a paladin spell you cast and when making an attack roll\nwith one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma\nmodifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your\nCharisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use a holy symbol\nas a spellcasting focus for your paladin spells.\nDivine Smite\nStarting at 2nd level, when you hit a creature with a melee weapon\nattack, you can expend one spell slot to deal radiant damage to the\ntarget, in addition to the weapon’s damage. The extra damage is 2d8\nfor a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher\nthan 1st, to a maximum of 5d8. The damage increases by 1d8 if the\ntarget is an undead or a fiend.\nDivine Health\nBy 3rd level, the divine magic flowing through you makes you immune\nto disease.\nSacred Oath\nWhen you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a\npaladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory\nstage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose\nthe Oath of Devotion, the Oath of\nthe Ancients, or the Oath of Vengeance, all detailed at the end of\nthe class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th,\nand 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel\nDivinity feature.\nOath Spells\nEach oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these\nspells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you\ngain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath\nspells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each\nday.\nIf you gain an oath spell that doesn’t appear on the paladin spell\nlist, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.\nChannel Divinity\nYour oath allows you to channel divine energy to fuel magical\neffects. Each Channel Divinity option provided by your oath explains\nhow to use it.\nWhen you use your Channel Divinity, you choose which option to use.\nYou must then finish a short or long rest to use your Channel\nDivinity again.\nSome Channel Divinity effects require saving throws. When you use\nsuch an effect from this class, the DC equals your paladin spell\nsave DC.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nAura of Protection\nStarting at 6th level, whenever you or a friendly creature within 10\nfeet of you must make a saving throw, the creature gains a bonus to\nthe saving throw equal to your Charisma modifier (with a minimum\nbonus of +1). You must be conscious to grant this bonus.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nAura of Courage\nStarting at 10th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of\nyou can’t be frightened while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nImproved Divine Smite\nBy 11th level, you are so suffused with righteous might that all your melee weapon strikes carry divine power with them. Whenever you hit a creature with a melee weapon, the creature takes an extra 1d8 radiant damage. If you also use your Divine Smite with an attack, you add this damage to the extra damage of your Divine Smite.\nCleansing Touch\nBeginning at 14th level, you can use your action to end one spell on\nyourself or on one willing creature that you touch.\nYou can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma\nmodifier (a minimum of once). You regain expended uses when you\nfinish a long rest.\nSacred Oaths\nBecoming a paladin involves taking vows that commit the paladin to\nthe cause of righteousness, an active path of fighting wickedness.\nThe final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the\nculmination of all the paladin’s training. Some characters with this\nclass don’t consider themselves true paladins until they have\nreached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual\nswearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has\nalways been true in the paladin’s heart.\nBreaking Your Oath\nA paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but\neven the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path\nproves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of\ntwo evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to\ntransgress his or her oath.\nA paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a\ncleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the\nsame order. The paladin might spend an all-night vigil in prayer as\na sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of\nselfbdenial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin\nstarts fresh.\nIf a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of\nrepentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM’s\ndiscretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this\nclass and adopt another.\nOath of Devotion\nThe Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some, for better or worse, hold the rest of the world to the same standards. Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods’ tenets as the measure of their devotion. They hold angels—the perfect servants of good—as their ideals, and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.\nTenets of Devotion\nThough the exact words and strictures of the Oath of Devotion vary, paladins of this oath share these tenets.\nHonesty. Don’t lie or cheat. Let your word be your promise.\nCourage. Never fear to act, though caution is wise.\nCompassion. Aid others, protect the weak, and punish those who threaten them. Show mercy to your foes, but temper it with wisdom.\nHonor. Treat others with fairness, and let your honorable deeds be an example to them. Do as much good as possible while causing the least amount of harm.\nDuty. Be responsible for your actions and their consequences, protect those entrusted to your care, and obey those who have just authority over you.\nOath Spells\nYou gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.\nOath of Devotion Spells\nPaladin Level\nSpells\n3rd\nprotection from evil and good,\nsanctuary\n5th\nlesser restoration,\nzone of truth\n9th\nbeacon of hope,\ndispel magic\n13th\nfreedom of movement,\nguardian of faith\n17th\ncommune,\nflame strike\nChannel Divinity\nWhen you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.\nSacred Weapon. As an action, you can imbue one weapon that you are holding with positive energy, using your Channel Divinity.  For 1 minute, you add your Charisma modifier to attack rolls made with that weapon (with a minimum bonus of +1). The weapon also emits bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light 20 feet beyond that.  If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.\nYou can end this effect on your turn as part of any other action. If you are no longer holding or carrying this weapon, or if you fall unconscious, this effect ends.\nTurn the Unholy. As an action, you present your holy symbol and speak a prayer censuring fiends and undead, using your Channel Divinity. Each fiend or undead that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.\nA turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.\nAura of Devotion\nStarting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of\nyou can’t be charmed while you are conscious.\nAt 18th level, the range of this aura increases to 30 feet.\nPurity of Spirit\nBeginning at 15th level, you are always under the effects of a protection from evil and good spell.\nHoly Nimbus\nAt 20th level, as an action, you can emanate an aura of sunlight.\nFor 1 minute, bright light shines from you in a 30-foot radius, and\ndim light shines 30 feet beyond that.\nWhenever an enemy creature starts its turn in the bright light, the\ncreature takes 10 radiant damage.\nIn addition, for the duration, you have advantage on saving throws\nagainst spells cast by fiends or undead.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a\nlong rest."

Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.\nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.\nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.\nNatural Explorer\nYou are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.\nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:\nDifficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.\nYour group can’t become lost except by magical means.\nEven when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\nIf you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\nWhen you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\nWhile tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.\nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.\nFighting Style\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nArchery\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.\nDefense\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nDueling\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.\nSpellcasting\nBy the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.\nSpell Slots\nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRanger Archetype\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.\nPrimeval Awareness\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you.  For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLand’s Stride\nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.\nHide in Plain Sight\nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.\nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.\nVanish\nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.\nFeral Senses\nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.\nFoe Slayer\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.  Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.\nRanger Archetypes\nThe ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.\nHunter\nEmulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.\nHunter’s Prey\nAt 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nColossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.\nGiant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.\nHorde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.\nDefensive Tactics\nAt 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEscape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.\nMultiattack Defense. When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.\nSteel Will. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\nMultiattack\nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nVolley. You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.\nWhirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.\nSuperior Hunter’s Defense\nAt 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEvasion. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nStand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\nUncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you."

Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies.\nYou have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them. When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice that is spoken by your favored enemies, if they speak one at all.\nYou choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th and 14th level. As you gain levels, your choices should reflect the types of monsters you have encountered on your adventures.\nNatural Explorer\nYou are particularly familiar with one type of natural environment and are adept at traveling and surviving in such regions. Choose one type of favored terrain: arctic, coast, desert, forest, grassland, mountain, or swamp. When you make an Intelligence or Wisdom check related to your favored terrain, your proficiency bonus is doubled if you are using a skill that you’re proficient in.\nWhile traveling for an hour or more in your favored terrain, you gain the following benefits:\nDifficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel.\nYour group can’t become lost except by magical means.\nEven when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.\nIf you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.\nWhen you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would.\nWhile tracking other creatures, you also learn their exact number, their sizes, and how long ago they passed through the area.\nYou choose additional favored terrain types at 6th and 10th level.\nFighting Style\nAt 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.\nArchery\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons.\nDefense\nWhile you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.\nDueling\nWhen you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\nWhen you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.\nSpellcasting\nBy the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list.\nSpell Slots\nThe Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nFor example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nYou know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nWisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier\nRanger Archetype\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate: Hunter or Beast Master, both detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.\nPrimeval Awareness\nBeginning at 3rd level, you can use your action and expend one ranger spell slot to focus your awareness on the region around you.  For 1 minute per level of the spell slot you expend, you can sense whether the following types of creatures are present within 1 mile of you (or within up to 6 miles if you are in your favored terrain): aberrations, celestials, dragons, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead. This feature doesn’t reveal the creatures’ location or number.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nExtra Attack\nBeginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nLand’s Stride\nStarting at 8th level, moving through nonmagical difficult terrain costs you no extra movement. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard.\nIn addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such those created by the entangle spell.\nHide in Plain Sight\nStarting at 10th level, you can spend 1 minute creating camouflage for yourself. You must have access to fresh mud, dirt, plants, soot, and other naturally occurring materials with which to create your camouflage.\nOnce you are camouflaged in this way, you can try to hide by pressing yourself up against a solid surface, such as a tree or wall, that is at least as tall and wide as you are. You gain a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks as long as you remain there without moving or taking actions. Once you move or take an action or a reaction, you must camouflage yourself again to gain this benefit.\nVanish\nStarting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail.\nFeral Senses\nAt 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it.\nYou are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened.\nFoe Slayer\nAt 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter of your enemies.  Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make against one of your favored enemies. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.\nRanger Archetypes\nThe ideal of the ranger has two classic expressions: the Hunter and the Beast Master.\nHunter\nEmulating the Hunter archetype means accepting your place as a bulwark between civilization and the terrors of the wilderness. As you walk the Hunter’s path, you learn specialized techniques for fighting the threats you face, from rampaging ogres and hordes of orcs to towering giants and terrifying dragons.\nHunter’s Prey\nAt 3rd level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nColossus Slayer. Your tenacity can wear down the most potent foes. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, the creature takes an extra 1d8 damage if it’s below its hit point maximum. You can deal this extra damage only once per turn.\nGiant Killer. When a Large or larger creature within 5 feet of you hits or misses you with an attack, you can use your reaction to attack that creature immediately after its attack, provided that you can see the creature.\nHorde Breaker. Once on each of your turns when you make a weapon attack, you can make another attack with the same weapon against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.\nDefensive Tactics\nAt 7th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEscape the Horde. Opportunity attacks against you are made with disadvantage.\nMultiattack Defense. When a creature hits you with an attack, you gain a +4 bonus to AC against all subsequent attacks made by that creature for the rest of the turn.\nSteel Will. You have advantage on saving throws against being frightened.\nMultiattack\nAt 11th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nVolley. You can use your action to make a ranged attack against any number of creatures within 10 feet of a point you can see within your weapon’s range. You must have ammunition for each target, as normal, and you make a separate attack roll for each target.\nWhirlwind Attack. You can use your action to make a melee attack against any number of creatures within 5 feet of you, with a separate attack roll for each target.\nSuperior Hunter’s Defense\nAt 15th level, you gain one of the following features of your choice.\nEvasion. When you are subjected to an effect, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or a lightning bolt spell, that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nStand Against the Tide. When a hostile creature misses you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to force that creature to repeat the same attack against another creature (other than itself) of your choice.\nUncanny Dodge. When an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you."

The attack must use a finesse or a ranged weapon.\nYou don’t need advantage on the attack roll if another enemy of the\ntarget is within 5 feet of it, that enemy isn’t incapacitated, and\nyou don’t have disadvantage on the attack roll.\nThe amount of the extra damage increases as you gain levels in this\nclass, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue table.\nThieves’ Cant\nDuring your rogue training you learned thieves’ cant, a secret mix\nof dialect, jargon, and code that allows you to hide messages in\nseemingly normal conversation. Only another creature that knows\nthieves’ cant understands such messages. It takes four times longer\nto convey such a message than it does to speak the same idea\nplainly.\nIn addition, you understand a set of secret signs and symbols used\nto convey short, simple messages, such as whether an area is\ndangerous or the territory of a thieves’ guild, whether loot is\nnearby, or whether the people in an area are easy marks or will\nprovide a safe house for thieves on the run.\nCunning Action\nStarting at 2nd level, your quick thinking and agility allow you to move and act quickly. You can take a bonus action on each of your turns in combat. This action can be used only to take the Dash, Disengage, or Hide action.\nRoguish Archetype\nAt 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you emulate in the exercise of your rogue abilities: Thief, Assassin, or Arcane Trickster, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your archetype choice grants you features at 3rd level and then again at 9th, 13th, and 17th level.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nUncanny Dodge\nStarting at 5th level, when an attacker that you can see hits you with an attack, you can use your reaction to halve the attack’s damage against you.\nEvasion\nBeginning at 7th level, you can nimbly dodge out of the way of certain area effects, such as a red dragon’s fiery breath or an ice storm spell.  When you are subjected to an effect that allows you to make a Dexterity saving throw to take only half damage, you instead take no damage if you succeed on the saving throw, and only half damage if you fail.\nReliable Talent\nBy 11th level, you have refined your chosen skills until they approach perfection. Whenever you make an ability check that lets you add your proficiency bonus, you can treat a d20 roll of 9 or lower as a 10.\nBlindsense\nStarting at 14th level, if you are able to hear, you are aware of the location of any hidden or invisible creature within 10 feet of you.\nSlippery Mind\nBy 15th level, you have acquired greater mental strength. You gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws.\nElusive\nBeginning at 18th level, you are so evasive that attackers rarely gain the upper hand against you. No attack roll has advantage against you while you aren’t incapacitated.\nStroke of Luck\nAt 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. If your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nRoguish Archetypes\nRogues have many features in common, including their emphasis on perfecting their skills, their precise and deadly approach to combat, and their increasingly quick reflexes. But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focus—not necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.\nThief\nYou hone your skills in the larcenous arts. Burglars, bandits, cutpurses, and other criminals typically follow this archetype, but so do rogues who prefer to think of themselves as professional treasure seekers, explorers, delvers, and investigators. In addition to improving your agility and stealth, you learn skills useful for delving into ancient ruins, reading unfamiliar languages, and using magic items you normally couldn’t employ.\nFast Hands\nStarting at 3rd level, you can use the bonus action granted by your Cunning Action to make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check, use your thieves’ tools to disarm a trap or open a lock, or take the Use an Object action.\nSecond-Story Work\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain the ability to climb faster than normal; climbing no longer costs you extra movement.\nIn addition, when you make a running jump, the distance you cover increases by a number of feet equal to your Dexterity modifier.\nSupreme Sneak\nStarting at 9th level, you have advantage on a Dexterity (Stealth) check if you move no more than half your speed on the same turn.\nUse Magic Device\nBy 13th level, you have learned enough about the workings of magic that you can improvise the use of items even when they are not intended for you. You ignore all class, race, and level requirements on the use of magic items.\nThief’s Reflexes\nWhen you reach 17th level, you have become adept at laying ambushes and quickly escaping danger. You can take two turns during the first round of any combat. You take your first turn at your normal initiative and your second turn at your initiative minus 10. You can’t use this feature when you are surprised."

In addition, you use your Charisma\nmodifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you\ncast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma\nmodifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your\nCharisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane\nfocus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\nSorcerous Origin\nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate\nmagical power: Draconic Bloodline\nor Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and\nagain at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\nFont of Magic\nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within\nyourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which\nallow you to create a variety of magical effects.\nSorcery Points\nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher\nlevels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table.\nYou can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for\nyour level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a\nlong rest.\nFlexible Casting\nYou can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or\nsacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn\nother ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.\nCreating Spell Slots. You can transform unexpended sorcery\npoints into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The\nCreating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot\nof a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than\n5th.\nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.\nCreating Spell Slots\nSpell Slot Level\nSorcery Point Cost\n1st\n2\n2nd\n3\n3rd\n5\n4th\n6\n5th\n7\nConverting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a bonus action\non your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of\nsorcery points equal to the slot’s level.\nMetamagic\nAt 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your\nneeds. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your\nchoice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,\nunless otherwise noted.\nCareful Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving\nthrow, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full\nforce. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of\nthose creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one\ncreature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving\nthrow against the spell.\nDistant Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can\nspend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1\nsorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.\nEmpowered Spell\nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to\nreroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier\n(minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.\nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a\ndifferent Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.\nExtended Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you\ncan spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum\nduration of 24 hours.\nHeightened Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw\nto resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one\ntarget of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made\nagainst the spell.\nQuickened Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can\nspend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action\nfor this casting.\nSubtle Spell\nWhen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it\nwithout any somatic or verbal components.\nTwinned Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t\nhave a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal\nto the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the\nsame spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).\nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSorcerous Restoration\nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\nSorcerous Origins\nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic.\nAlthough many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two\ncategories: a draconic bloodline\nand wild magic.\nDraconic Bloodline\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\nDragon Ancestor\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\nDraconic Ancestry\nDragon\nDamage Type\nBlack\nAcid\nBlue\nLightning\nBrass\nFire\nBronze\nLightning\nCopper\nAcid\nGold\nFire\nGreen\nPoison\nRed\nFire\nSilver\nCold\nWhite\nCold\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\nDraconic Resilience\nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\nElemental Affinity\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\nDragon Wings\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed.  You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\nYou can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\nDraconic Presence\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours."

You use your Charisma whenever a spell refers\nto your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma\nmodifier when setting the saving throw DC for a sorcerer spell you\ncast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma\nmodifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your\nCharisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane\nfocus as a spellcasting focus for your sorcerer spells.\nSorcerous Origin\nChoose a sorcerous origin, which describes the source of your innate\nmagical power: Draconic Bloodline\nor Wild Magic, both detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features when you choose it at 1st level and\nagain at 6th, 14th, and 18th level.\nFont of Magic\nAt 2nd level, you tap into a deep wellspring of magic within\nyourself. This wellspring is represented by sorcery points, which\nallow you to create a variety of magical effects.\nSorcery Points\nYou have 2 sorcery points, and you gain more as you reach higher\nlevels, as shown in the Sorcery Points column of the Sorcerer table.\nYou can never have more sorcery points than shown on the table for\nyour level. You regain all spent sorcery points when you finish a\nlong rest.\nFlexible Casting\nYou can use your sorcery points to gain additional spell slots, or\nsacrifice spell slots to gain additional sorcery points. You learn\nother ways to use your sorcery points as you reach higher levels.\nCreating Spell Slots. You can transform unexpended sorcery\npoints into one spell slot as a bonus action on your turn. The\nCreating Spell Slots table shows the cost of creating a spell slot\nof a given level. You can create spell slots no higher in level than\n5th.\nAny spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a long rest.\nCreating Spell Slots\nSpell Slot Level\nSorcery Point Cost\n1st\n2\n2nd\n3\n3rd\n5\n4th\n6\n5th\n7\nConverting a Spell Slot to Sorcery Points. As a bonus action\non your turn, you can expend one spell slot and gain a number of\nsorcery points equal to the slot’s level.\nMetamagic\nAt 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your\nneeds. You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your\nchoice. You gain another one at 10th and 17th level.\nYou can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it,\nunless otherwise noted.\nCareful Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that forces other creatures to make a saving\nthrow, you can protect some of those creatures from the spell’s full\nforce. To do so, you spend 1 sorcery point and choose a number of\nthose creatures up to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one\ncreature). A chosen creature automatically succeeds on its saving\nthrow against the spell.\nDistant Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of 5 feet or greater, you can\nspend 1 sorcery point to double the range of the spell.\nWhen you cast a spell that has a range of touch, you can spend 1\nsorcery point to make the range of the spell 30 feet.\nEmpowered Spell\nWhen you roll damage for a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to\nreroll a number of the damage dice up to your Charisma modifier\n(minimum of one). You must use the new rolls.\nYou can use Empowered Spell even if you have already used a\ndifferent Metamagic option during the casting of the spell.\nExtended Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that has a duration of 1 minute or longer, you\ncan spend 1 sorcery point to double its duration, to a maximum\nduration of 24 hours.\nHeightened Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that forces a creature to make a saving throw\nto resist its effects, you can spend 3 sorcery points to give one\ntarget of the spell disadvantage on its first saving throw made\nagainst the spell.\nQuickened Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that has a casting time of 1 action, you can\nspend 2 sorcery points to change the casting time to 1 bonus action\nfor this casting.\nSubtle Spell\nWhen you cast a spell, you can spend 1 sorcery point to cast it\nwithout any somatic or verbal components.\nTwinned Spell\nWhen you cast a spell that targets only one creature and doesn’t\nhave a range of self, you can spend a number of sorcery points equal\nto the spell’s level to target a second creature in range with the\nsame spell (1 sorcery point if the spell is a cantrip).\nTo be eligible, a spell must be incapable of targeting more than one creature at the spell’s current level. For example, magic missile and scorching ray aren’t eligible, but ray of frost and chromatic orb are.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th\nlevel, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or\nyou can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal,\nyou can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSorcerous Restoration\nAt 20th level, you regain 4 expended sorcery points whenever you finish a short rest.\nSorcerous Origins\nDifferent sorcerers claim different origins for their innate magic.\nAlthough many variations exist, most of these origins fall into two\ncategories: a draconic bloodline\nand wild magic.\nDraconic Bloodline\nYour innate magic comes from draconic magic that was mingled with your blood or that of your ancestors. Most often, sorcerers with this origin trace their descent back to a mighty sorcerer of ancient times who made a bargain with a dragon or who might even have claimed a dragon parent. Some of these bloodlines are well established in the world, but most are obscure. Any given sorcerer could be the first of a new bloodline, as a result of a pact or some other exceptional circumstance.\nDragon Ancestor\nAt 1st level, you choose one type of dragon as your ancestor. The damage type associated with each dragon is used by features you gain later.\nDraconic Ancestry\nDragon\nDamage Type\nBlack\nAcid\nBlue\nLightning\nBrass\nFire\nBronze\nLightning\nCopper\nAcid\nGold\nFire\nGreen\nPoison\nRed\nFire\nSilver\nCold\nWhite\nCold\nYou can speak, read, and write Draconic. Additionally, whenever you make a Charisma check when interacting with dragons, your proficiency bonus is doubled if it applies to the check.\nDraconic Resilience\nAs magic flows through your body, it causes physical traits of your dragon ancestors to emerge. At 1st level, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.\nAdditionally, parts of your skin are covered by a thin sheen of dragon-like scales. When you aren’t wearing armor, your AC equals 13 + your Dexterity modifier.\nElemental Affinity\nStarting at 6th level, when you cast a spell that deals damage of the type associated with your draconic ancestry, you can add your Charisma modifier to one damage roll of that spell. At the same time, you can spend 1 sorcery point to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 hour.\nDragon Wings\nAt 14th level, you gain the ability to sprout a pair of dragon wings from your back, gaining a flying speed equal to your current speed.  You can create these wings as a bonus action on your turn. They last until you dismiss them as a bonus action on your turn.\nYou can’t manifest your wings while wearing armor unless the armor is made to accommodate them, and clothing not made to accommodate your wings might be destroyed when you manifest them.\nDraconic Presence\nBeginning at 18th level, you can channel the dread presence of your dragon ancestor, causing those around you to become awestruck or frightened. As an action, you can spend 5 sorcery points to draw on this power and exude an aura of awe or fear (your choice) to a distance of 60 feet. For 1 minute or until you lose your concentration (as if you were casting a concentration spell), each hostile creature that starts its turn in this aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed (if you chose awe) or frightened (if you chose fear) until the aura ends. A creature that succeeds on this saving throw is immune to your aura for 24 hours."

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nPact Magic\nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.\nCantrips\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\nSpell Slots\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.\nEldritch Invocations\nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.\nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.  When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.\nPact Boon\nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.\nPact of the Chain\nYou learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.\nPact of the Blade\nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand.  You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\nPact of the Tome\nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nMystic Arcanum\nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Master\nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nEldritch Invocations\nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\nAgonizing Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\nArmor of Shadows\nYou can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nAscendant Step\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nBeast Speech\nYou can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.\nBeguiling Influence\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\nBewitching Whispers\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nBook of Ancient Secrets\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell.  For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\nChains of Carceri\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can cast hold monster at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.\nDevil’s Sight\nYou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.\nDreadful Word\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast confusion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Sight\nYou can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell slot.\nEldritch Spear\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, its range is 300 feet.\nEyes of the Rune Keeper\nYou can read all writing.\nFiendish Vigor\nYou can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nGaze of Two Minds\nYou can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.\nLifedrinker\nPrerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nMask of Many Faces\nYou can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMaster of Myriad Forms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMinions of Chaos\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nMire the Mind\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nYou can cast slow once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nMisty Visions\nYou can cast silent image at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nOne with Shadows\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nWhen you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction.\nOtherworldly Leap\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast jump on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nRepelling Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.\nSculptor of Flesh\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast polymorph once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nSign of Ill Omen\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nYou can cast bestow curse once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThief of Five Fates\nYou can cast bane once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThirsting Blade\nPrerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nVisions of Distant Realms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot.\nVoice of the Chain Master\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar’s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence.  Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.\nWhispers of the Grave\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot.\nWitch Sight\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.\nOtherworldly Patrons\nThe beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.\nYour Pact Boon\nEach Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.\nPact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.\nPact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.\nPact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.\nThe Fiend\nYou have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.\nExpanded Spell List\nThe Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\nFiend Expanded Spells\nSpell Level\nSpells\n1st\nburning hands,\ncommand\n2nd\nblindness/deafness,\nscorching ray\n3rd\nfireball,\nstinking cloud\n4th\nfire shield,\nwall of fire\n5th\nflame strike,\nhallow\nDark One’s Blessing\nStarting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).\nDark One’s Own Luck\nStarting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nFiendish Resilience\nStarting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.\nHurl Through Hell\nStarting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest."

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nPact Magic\nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.\nCantrips\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\nSpell Slots\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.\nEldritch Invocations\nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.\nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.  When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.\nPact Boon\nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.\nPact of the Chain\nYou learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.\nPact of the Blade\nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand.  You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\nPact of the Tome\nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nMystic Arcanum\nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Master\nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nEldritch Invocations\nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\nAgonizing Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\nArmor of Shadows\nYou can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nAscendant Step\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nBeast Speech\nYou can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.\nBeguiling Influence\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\nBewitching Whispers\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nBook of Ancient Secrets\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell.  For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\nChains of Carceri\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can cast hold monster at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.\nDevil’s Sight\nYou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.\nDreadful Word\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast confusion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Sight\nYou can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell slot.\nEldritch Spear\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, its range is 300 feet.\nEyes of the Rune Keeper\nYou can read all writing.\nFiendish Vigor\nYou can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nGaze of Two Minds\nYou can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.\nLifedrinker\nPrerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nMask of Many Faces\nYou can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMaster of Myriad Forms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMinions of Chaos\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nMire the Mind\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nYou can cast slow once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nMisty Visions\nYou can cast silent image at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nOne with Shadows\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nWhen you are in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to become invisible until you move or take an action or a reaction.\nOtherworldly Leap\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast jump on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nRepelling Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you hit a creature with eldritch blast, you can push the creature up to 10 feet away from you in a straight line.\nSculptor of Flesh\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast polymorph once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nSign of Ill Omen\nPrerequisite: 5th level\nYou can cast bestow curse once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThief of Five Fates\nYou can cast bane once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThirsting Blade\nPrerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nVisions of Distant Realms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot.\nVoice of the Chain Master\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar’s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence.  Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.\nWhispers of the Grave\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot.\nWitch Sight\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.\nOtherworldly Patrons\nThe beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.\nYour Pact Boon\nEach Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.\nPact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.\nPact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.\nPact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.\nThe Fiend\nYou have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.\nExpanded Spell List\nThe Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\nFiend Expanded Spells\nSpell Level\nSpells\n1st\nburning hands,\ncommand\n2nd\nblindness/deafness,\nscorching ray\n3rd\nfireball,\nstinking cloud\n4th\nfire shield,\nwall of fire\n5th\nflame strike,\nhallow\nDark One’s Blessing\nStarting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).\nDark One’s Own Luck\nStarting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nFiendish Resilience\nStarting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.\nHurl Through Hell\nStarting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest."

A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\nAgonizing Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\nArmor of Shadows\nYou can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nAscendant Step\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nBeast Speech\nYou can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.\nBeguiling Influence\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\nBewitching Whispers\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nBook of Ancient Secrets\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell.  For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\nChains of Carceri\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can cast hold monster at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components.

As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.\nLifedrinker\nPrerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nMask of Many Faces\nYou can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMaster of Myriad Forms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMinions of Chaos\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot.

You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThief of Five Fates\nYou can cast bane once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nThirsting Blade\nPrerequisite: 5th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nYou can attack with your pact weapon twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.\nVisions of Distant Realms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast arcane eye at will, without expending a spell slot.\nVoice of the Chain Master\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can communicate telepathically with your familiar and perceive through your familiar’s senses as long as you are on the same plane of existence.  Additionally, while perceiving through your familiar’s senses, you can also speak through your familiar in your own voice, even if your familiar is normally incapable of speech.\nWhispers of the Grave\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast speak with dead at will, without expending a spell slot.\nWitch Sight\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can see the true form of any shapechanger or creature concealed by illusion or transmutation magic while the creature is within 30 feet of you and within line of sight.\nOtherworldly Patrons\nThe beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence—not gods, but almost godlike in their power. Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will. Other patrons bestow their power only grudgingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock. Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.\nYour Pact Boon\nEach Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects your patron’s nature.\nPact of the Chain. Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar. Its default form can be a reflection of your patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend. Because the Great Old One’s nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.\nPact of the Blade. If your patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines. If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames. If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with a gemstone embedded in its head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.\nPact of the Tome. Your Book of Shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey. It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and a wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend. Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contact with the Great Old One, holding scraps of spells that only your own burgeoning insanity allows you to understand and cast.\nThe Fiend\nYou have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims. Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you. Fiends powerful enough to forge a pact include demon lords such as Demogorgon, Orcus, Fraz’Urb-luu, and Baphomet; archdevils such as Asmodeus, Dispater, Mephistopheles, and Belial; pit fiends and balors that are especially mighty; and ultroloths and other lords of the yugoloths.\nExpanded Spell List\nThe Fiend lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.\nFiend Expanded Spells\nSpell Level\nSpells\n1st\nburning hands,\ncommand\n2nd\nblindness/deafness,\nscorching ray\n3rd\nfireball,\nstinking cloud\n4th\nfire shield,\nwall of fire\n5th\nflame strike,\nhallow\nDark One’s Blessing\nStarting at 1st level, when you reduce a hostile creature to 0 hit points, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Charisma modifier + your warlock level (minimum of 1).\nDark One’s Own Luck\nStarting at 6th level, you can call on your patron to alter fate in your favor. When you make an ability check or a saving throw, you can use this feature to add a d10 to your roll. You can do so after seeing the initial roll but before any of the roll’s effects occur.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.\nFiendish Resilience\nStarting at 10th level, you can choose one damage type when you finish a short or long rest. You gain resistance to that damage type until you choose a different one with this feature. Damage from magical weapons or silver weapons ignores this resistance.\nHurl Through Hell\nStarting at 14th level, when you hit a creature with an attack, you can use this feature to instantly transport the target through the lower planes. The creature disappears and hurtles through a nightmare landscape.\nAt the end of your next turn, the target returns to the space it previously occupied, or the nearest unoccupied space. If the target is not a fiend, it takes 10d10 psychic damage as it reels from its horrific experience.\nOnce you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest."

Your choice grants you features at 1st level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nPact Magic\nYour arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.\nCantrips\nYou know two cantrips of your choice from the warlock spell list. You learn additional warlock cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Warlock table.\nSpell Slots\nThe Warlock table shows how many spell slots you have. The table also shows what the level of those slots is; all of your spell slots are the same level. To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a spell slot. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.\nFor example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots. To cast the 1st-level spell thunderwave, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.\nSpells Known of 1st Level and Higher\nAt 1st level, you know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the warlock spell list.\nThe Spells Known column of the Warlock table shows when you learn more warlock spells of your choice of 1st level and higher. A spell you choose must be of a level no higher than what’s shown in the table’s Slot Level column for your level. When you reach 6th level, for example, you learn a new warlock spell, which can be 1st, 2nd, or 3rd level.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nSpellcasting Ability\nCharisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your warlock spells.\nEldritch Invocations\nIn your study of occult lore, you have unearthed eldritch invocations, fragments of forbidden knowledge that imbue you with an abiding magical ability.\nAt 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice. Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.  When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.\nAdditionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.\nPact Boon\nAt 3rd level, your otherworldly patron bestows a gift upon you for your loyal service. You gain one of the following features of your choice.\nPact of the Chain\nYou learn the find familiar spell and can cast it as a ritual. The spell doesn’t count against your number of spells known.\nWhen you cast the spell, you can choose one of the normal forms for your familiar or one of the following special forms: imp, pseudodragon, quasit, or sprite.\nAdditionally, when you take the Attack action, you can forgo one of your own attacks to allow your familiar to make one attack of its own with its reaction.\nPact of the Blade\nYou can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand.  You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.\nYour pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.\nYou can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.\nPact of the Tome\nYour patron gives you a grimoire called a Book of Shadows. When you gain this feature, choose three cantrips from any class’s spell list (the three needn’t be from the same list). While the book is on your person, you can cast those cantrips at will. They don’t count against your number of cantrips known. If they don’t appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.\nIf you lose your Book of Shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron. This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroys the previous book. The book turns to ash when you die.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nMystic Arcanum\nAt 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum. Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum. You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot. You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nAt higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of your choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-level spell at 13th level, one 8th-level spell at 15th level, and one 9th-level spell at 17th level. You regain all uses of your Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Master\nAt 20th level, you can draw on your inner reserve of mystical power while entreating your patron to regain expended spell slots. You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expended spell slots from your Pact Magic feature. Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.\nEldritch Invocations\nIf an eldritch invocation has prerequisites, you must meet them to learn it. You can learn the invocation at the same time that you meet its prerequisites. A level prerequisite refers to your level in this class.\nAgonizing Blast\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, add your Charisma modifier to the damage it deals on a hit.\nArmor of Shadows\nYou can cast mage armor on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nAscendant Step\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast levitate on yourself at will, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nBeast Speech\nYou can cast speak with animals at will, without expending a spell slot.\nBeguiling Influence\nYou gain proficiency in the Deception and Persuasion skills.\nBewitching Whispers\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast compulsion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nBook of Ancient Secrets\nPrerequisite: Pact of the Tome feature\nYou can now inscribe magical rituals in your Book of Shadows. Choose two 1st-level spells that have the ritual tag from any class’s spell list (the two needn’t be from the same list). The spells appear in the book and don’t count against the number of spells you know. With your Book of Shadows in hand, you can cast the chosen spells as rituals. You can’t cast the spells except as rituals, unless you’ve learned them by some other means. You can also cast a warlock spell you know as a ritual if it has the ritual tag.\nOn your adventures, you can add other ritual spells to your Book of Shadows. When you find such a spell, you can add it to the book if the spell’s level is equal to or less than half your warlock level (rounded up) and if you can spare the time to transcribe the spell.  For each level of the spell, the transcription process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp for the rare inks needed to inscribe it.\nChains of Carceri\nPrerequisite: 15th level, Pact of the Chain feature\nYou can cast hold monster at will—targeting a celestial, fiend, or elemental—without expending a spell slot or material components. You must finish a long rest before you can use this invocation on the same creature again.\nDevil’s Sight\nYou can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 120 feet.\nDreadful Word\nPrerequisite: 7th level\nYou can cast confusion once using a warlock spell slot. You can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.\nEldritch Sight\nYou can cast detect magic at will, without expending a spell slot.\nEldritch Spear\nPrerequisite: eldritch blast cantrip\nWhen you cast eldritch blast, its range is 300 feet.\nEyes of the Rune Keeper\nYou can read all writing.\nFiendish Vigor\nYou can cast false life on yourself at will as a 1st-level spell, without expending a spell slot or material components.\nGaze of Two Minds\nYou can use your action to touch a willing humanoid and perceive through its senses until the end of your next turn. As long as the creature is on the same plane of existence as you, you can use your action on subsequent turns to maintain this connection, extending the duration until the end of your next turn. While perceiving through the other creature’s senses, you benefit from any special senses possessed by that creature, and you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings.\nLifedrinker\nPrerequisite: 12th level, Pact of the Blade feature\nWhen you hit a creature with your pact weapon, the creature takes extra necrotic damage equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 1).\nMask of Many Faces\nYou can cast disguise self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMaster of Myriad Forms\nPrerequisite: 15th level\nYou can cast alter self at will, without expending a spell slot.\nMinions of Chaos\nPrerequisite: 9th level\nYou can cast conjure elemental once using a warlock spell slot.

Various patrons give their warlocks access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.\nSome patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will.

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\nSpellbook\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the Your Spellbook sidebar).\nArcane Recovery\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\nArcane Tradition\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSpell Mastery\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.\nSignature Spells\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nYour Spellbook\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\nReplacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.  Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\nThe Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\nArcane Traditions\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.\nSchool of Evocation\nYou focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\nEvocation Savant\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\nSculpt Spells\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\nPotent Cantrip\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\nEmpowered Evocation\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\nOverchannel\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.  This damage ignores resistance and immunity."

You learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table.\nSpellbook\nAt 1st level, you have a spellbook containing six 1st-level wizard spells of your choice. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know, except your cantrips, which are fixed in your mind.\nPreparing and Casting Spells\nThe Wizard table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.\nYou prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast. To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.\nFor example, if you’re a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your list of prepared spells.\nYou can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.\nSpellcasting Ability\nIntelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a wizard spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\nSpell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nSpell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Intelligence modifier\nRitual Casting\nYou can cast a wizard spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell in your spellbook. You don’t need to have the spell prepared.\nSpellcasting Focus\nYou can use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your wizard spells.\nLearning Spells of 1st Level and Higher\nEach time you gain a wizard level, you can add two wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see the Your Spellbook sidebar).\nArcane Recovery\nYou have learned to regain some of your magical energy by studying your spellbook. Once per day when you finish a short rest, you can choose expended spell slots to recover. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your wizard level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher.\nFor example, if you’re a 4th-level wizard, you can recover up to two levels worth of spell slots. You can recover either a 2nd-level spell slot or two 1st-level spell slots.\nArcane Tradition\nWhen you reach 2nd level, you choose an arcane tradition, shaping your practice of magic through one of eight schools: Abjuration, Conjuration, Divination, Enchantment, Evocation, Illusion, Necromancy, or Transmutation, all detailed at the end of the class description.\nYour choice grants you features at 2nd level and again at 6th, 10th, and 14th level.\nAbility Score Improvement\nWhen you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\nSpell Mastery\nAt 18th level, you have achieved such mastery over certain spells that you can cast them at will. Choose a 1st-level wizard spell and a 2nd-level wizard spell that are in your spellbook. You can cast those spells at their lowest level without expending a spell slot when you have them prepared. If you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nBy spending 8 hours in study, you can exchange one or both of the spells you chose for different spells of the same levels.\nSignature Spells\nWhen you reach 20th level, you gain mastery over two powerful spells and can cast them with little effort. Choose two 3rd-level wizard spells in your spellbook as your signature spells. You always have these spells prepared, they don’t count against the number of spells you have prepared, and you can cast each of them once at 3rd level without expending a spell slot. When you do so, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.\nIf you want to cast either spell at a higher level, you must expend a spell slot as normal.\nYour Spellbook\nThe spells that you add to your spellbook as you gain levels reflect the arcane research you conduct on your own, as well as intellectual breakthroughs you have had about the nature of the multiverse. You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard’s chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.\nCopying a Spell into the Book. When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.\nCopying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.\nFor each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.\nReplacing the Book. You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book—for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.\nIf you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook.  Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.\nThe Book’s Appearance. Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.\nArcane Traditions\nThe study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.\nThe most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools; a wizard might study at the School of Illusion while another studies across town at the School of Enchantment. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.\nSchool of Evocation\nYou focus your study on magic that creates powerful elemental effects such as bitter cold, searing flame, rolling thunder, crackling lightning, and burning acid. Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.\nEvocation Savant\nBeginning when you select this school at 2nd level, the gold and time you must spend to copy an evocation spell into your spellbook is halved.\nSculpt Spells\nBeginning at 2nd level, you can create pockets of relative safety within the effects of your evocation spells. When you cast an evocation spell that affects other creatures that you can see, you can choose a number of them equal to 1 + the spell’s level. The chosen creatures automatically succeed on their saving throws against the spell, and they take no damage if they would normally take half damage on a successful save.\nPotent Cantrip\nStarting at 6th level, your damaging cantrips affect even creatures that avoid the brunt of the effect. When a creature succeeds on a saving throw against your cantrip, the creature takes half the cantrip’s damage (if any) but suffers no additional effect from the cantrip.\nEmpowered Evocation\nBeginning at 10th level, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of any wizard evocation spell you cast.\nOverchannel\nStarting at 14th level, you can increase the power of your simpler spells. When you cast a wizard spell of 1st through 5th level that deals damage, you can deal maximum damage with that spell.\nThe first time you do so, you suffer no adverse effect. If you use this feature again before you finish a long rest, you take 2d12 necrotic damage for each level of the spell, immediately after you cast it. Each time you use this feature again before finishing a long rest, the necrotic damage per spell level increases by 1d12.  This damage ignores resistance and immunity."

    "text": "Equipment\nEquipment\nCommon coins come in several different denominations based on the\nrelative worth of the metal from which they are made. The three most\ncommon coins are the gold piece (gp), the silver piece (sp), and the\ncopper piece (cp).\nWith one gold piece, a character can buy a bedroll, 50 feet of good\nrope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional) artisan can earn\none gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of measure\nfor wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When\nmerchants discuss deals that involve goods or services worth\nhundreds or thousands of gold pieces, the transactions don’t usually\ninvolve the exchange of individual coins. Rather, the gold piece is\na standard measure of value, and the actual exchange is in gold\nbars, letters of credit, or valuable goods.\nOne gold piece is worth ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin\namong commoners. A silver piece buys a laborer’s work for half a\nday, a flask of lamp oil, or a night’s rest in a poor inn.\nOne silver piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among\nlaborers and beggars. A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch,\nor a piece of chalk.\nIn addition, unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes\nappear in treasure hoards. The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum\npiece (pp) originate from fallen empires and lost kingdoms, and they\nsometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used in transactions.\nAn electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum piece\nis worth ten gold pieces.\nA standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce, so fifty coins\nweigh a pound.\nStandard Exchange Rates\nCoin\nCP\nSP\nEP\nGP\nPP\nCopper (cp)\n1\n1/10\n1/50\n1/1000\n1/1,000\nSilver (sp)\n10\n1\n1/5\n1/10\n1/100\nElectrum (ep)\n50\n5\n1\n1/2\n1/20\nGold (gp)\n100\n10\n2\n1\n1/10\nPlatinum (pp)\n1,000\n100\n20\n10\n1"

    "text": "Selling Treasure\nSelling Treasure\nOpportunities abound to find treasure, equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement, provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot.\nArms, Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell.\nMagic Items. Selling magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn’t too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles. Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won’t normally come across magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold and should always be treated as such.\nGems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable treasures, the GM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger community first.\nTrade Goods. On the borderlands, many people conduct transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods—bars of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on—retain their full value in the market and can be used as currency."

    "text": "Armor\nArmor\nFantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.\nThe Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.\nArmor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor’s use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can’t cast spells.\nArmor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.\nHeavy Armor. Heavier armor interferes with the wearer’s ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows Str 13 or Str 15 in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer’s speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.\nStealth. If the Armor table shows Disadvantage in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.\nShields. A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.\nLight Armor\nMade from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nPadded. Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.\nLeather. The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.\nStudded Leather. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close set rivets or spikes.\nMedium Armor\nMedium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.\nHide. This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.\nChain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer’s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.\nScale Mail. This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.\nBreastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer’s vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.\nHalf Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer’s body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.\nHeavy Armor\nOf all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.\nHeavy armor doesn’t let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn’t penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.\nRing Mail. This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it’s usually worn only by those who can’t afford better armor.\nChain Mail. Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.\nSplint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail protects the joints.\nPlate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots, a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and straps distribute the weight over the body.\nGetting Into and Out of Armor\nThe time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor’s category.\nDon. This is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor’s AC only if you take the full time to don the suit of armor.\nDoff. This is the time it takes to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half.\nDonning and Doffing Armor\nCategory\nDon\nDoff\nLight Armor\n1 minute\n1 minute\nMedium Armor\n5 minute\n1 minute\nHeavy Armor\n10 minute\n5 minute\nShield\n1 action\n1 action\nArmor\nArmor\nCost\nArmor Class (AC)\nStrength\nStealth\nWeight\nLight Armor\nPadded\n5 gp\n11 + Dex modifier\n—\nDisadvantage\n8 lb.\nLeather\n10 gp\n11 + Dex modifier\n—\n—\n10 lb.\nStudded Leather\n45 gp\n12 + Dex modifier\n—\n—\n13 lb.\nMedium Armor\nHide\n10 gp\n12 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n—\n—\n12 lb.\nChain Shirt\n50 gp\n13 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n—\n—\n20 lb.\nScale Mail\n50 gp\n14 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n—\nDisadvantage\n45 lb.\nBreastplate\n400 gp\n14 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n—\n—\n20 lb.\nHalf Plate\n750 gp\n15 + Dex modifier (max 2)\n—\nDisadvantage\n40 lb.\nHeavy Armor\nRing Mail\n30 gp\n14\n—\nDisadvantage\n40 lb.\nChain Mail\n75 gp\n16\nStr 13\nDisadvantage\n55 lb.\nSplint\n200 gp\n17\nStr 15\nDisadvantage\n60 lb.\nPlate\n1,500 gp\n18\nStr 15\nDisadvantage\n65 lb.\nShield\nShield\n10 gp\n+2\n—\n—\n6 lb."

    "text": "Weapons\nWeapons\nYour class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class’s focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.\nThe Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A melee weapon is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a ranged weapon is used to attack a target at a distance.\nWeapon Proficiency\nYour race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are simple and martial. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.\nProficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.\nWeapon Properties\nMany weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.\nAmmunition. You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.\nIf you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see Improvised Weapons later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way.\nFinesse. When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.\nHeavy. Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon’s size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.\nLight. A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.\nLoading. Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\nRange. A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon’s normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon’s long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can’t attack a target beyond the weapon’s long range.\nReach. This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.\nSpecial. A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon’s description (see Special Weapons later in this section).\nThrown. If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.\nTwo-Handed. This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.\nVersatile. This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.\nImprovised Weapons\nSometimes characters don’t have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.\nOften, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM’s option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.\nAn object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.\nSilvered Weapons\nSome monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.\nSpecial Weapons\nWeapons with special rules are described here.\nLance. You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren’t mounted.\nNet. A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.\nWhen you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.\nWeapons\nName\nCost\nDamage\nWeight\nProperties\nSimple Melee Weapons\nClub\n1 sp\n1d4 bludgeoning\n2 lb.\nLight\nDagger\n2 gp\n1d4 piercing\n1 lb.\nFinesse,\nlight,\nthrown (range 20/60)\nGreatclub\n2 sp\n1d8 bludgeoning\n10 lb.\nTwo-handed\nHandaxe\n5 gp\n1d6 slashing\n2 lb.\nLight,\nthrown (range 20/60)\nJavelin\n5 sp\n1d6 piercing\n2 lb.\nThrown (range 30/120)\nLight hammer\n2 gp\n1d4 bludgeoning\n2 lb.\nLight,\nthrown (range 20/60)\nMace\n5 gp\n1d6 bludgeoning\n4 lb.\n—\nQuarterstaff\n2 sp\n1d6 bludgeoning\n4 lb.\nVersatile (1d8)\nSickle\n1 gp\n1d4 slashing\n2 lb.\nLight\nSpear\n1 gp\n1d6 piercing\n3 lb.\nThrown (range 20/60),\nversatile (1d8)\nSimple Ranged Weapons\nCrossbow, light\n25 gp\n1d8 piercing\n5 lb.\nAmmunition (range 80/320),\nloading,\ntwo-handed\nDart\n5 cp\n1d4 piercing\n¼ lb.\nFinesse,\nthrown (range 20/60)\nShortbow\n25 gp\n1d6 piercing\n2 lb.\nAmmunition (range 80/320),\ntwo-handed\nSling\n1 sp\n1d4 bludgeoning\n—\nAmmunition (range 30/120)\nMartial Melee Weapons\nBattleaxe\n10 gp\n1d8 slashing\n4 lb.\nVersatile (1d10)\nFlail\n10 gp\n1d8 bludgeoning\n2 lb.\n—\nGlaive\n20 gp\n1d10 slashing\n6 lb.\nHeavy,\nreach,\ntwo-handed\nGreataxe\n30 gp\n1d12 slashing\n7 lb.\nHeavy,\ntwo-handed\nGreatsword\n50 gp\n2d6 slashing\n6 lb.\nHeavy,\ntwo-handed\nHalberd\n20 gp\n1d10 slashing\n6 lb.\nHeavy,\nreach,\ntwo-handed\nLance\n10 gp\n1d12 piercing\n6 lb.\nReach,\nspecial\nLongsword\n15 gp\n1d8 slashing\n3 lb.\nVersatile (1d10)\nMaul\n10 gp\n2d6 bludgeoning\n10 lb.\nHeavy,\ntwo-handed\nMorningstar\n15 gp\n1d8 piercing\n4 lb.\n—\nPike\n5 gp\n1d10 piercing\n18 lb.\nHeavy,\nreach,\ntwo-handed\nRapier\n25 gp\n1d8 piercing\n2 lb.\nFinesse\nScimitar\n25 gp\n1d6 slashing\n3 lb.\nFinesse,\nlight\nShortsword\n10 gp\n1d6 piercing\n2 lb.\nFinesse,\nlight\nTrident\n5 gp\n1d6 piercing\n4 lb.\nThrown (range 20/60),\nversatile (1d8)\nWar pick\n5 gp\n1d8 piercing\n2 lb.\n—\nWarhammer\n15 gp\n1d8 bludgeoning\n2 lb.\nVersatile (1d10)\nWhip\n2 gp\n1d4 slashing\n3 lb.\nFinesse,\nreach\nMartial Ranged Weapons\nBlowgun\n10 gp\n1 piercing\n1 lb.\nAmmunition (range 25/100),\nloading\nCrossbow, hand\n75 gp\n1d6 piercing\n3 lb.\nAmmunition (range 30/120),\nlight,\nloading\nCrossbow, heavy\n50 gp\n1d10 piercing\n18 lb.\nAmmunition (range 100/400),\nheavy,\nloading,\ntwo-handed\nLongbow\n50 gp\n1d8 piercing\n2 lb.\nAmmunition (range 150/600),\nheavy,\ntwo-handed\nNet\n1 gp\n—\n3 lb.\nSpecial,\nthrown (range 5/15)"

    "text": "Adventuring Gear\nAdventuring Gear\nThis section describes items that have special rules or require\nfurther explanation.\nAcid. As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.\nAlchemist’s Fire. This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist’s fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.\nAntitoxin. A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.\nArcane Focus. An arcane focus is a special item—an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item—designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.\nBall Bearings. As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.\nBlock and Tackle. A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.\nBook. A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).\nCaltrops. As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature’s walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn’t need to make the save.\nCandle. For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.\nCase, Crossbow Bolt. This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.\nCase, Map or Scroll. This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.\nChain. A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.\nClimber’s Kit. A climber’s kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber’s kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can’t fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can’t climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.\nComponent Pouch. A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell’s description).\nCrowbar. Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar’s leverage can be applied.\nDruidic Focus. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.\nFishing Tackle. This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.\nHealer’s Kit. This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nHoly Symbol. A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix B lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.\nHoly Water. As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage.\nA cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.\nHunting Trap. When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.\nLamp. A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.\nLantern, Bullseye. A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.\nLantern, Hooded. A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\nLock. A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.\nMagnifying Glass. This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.\nManacles. These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves’ tools can pick the manacles’ lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check.  Manacles have 15 hit points.\nMess Kit. This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.\nOil. Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level.  If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.\nPoison, Basic. You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition.  Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.\nPotion of Healing. A character who\ndrinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit\npoints. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.\nPouch. A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).\nQuiver. A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.\nRam, Portable. You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.\nRations. Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.\nRope. Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.\nScale, Merchant’s. A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.\nSpellbook. Essential for\nwizards, a spellbook is a\nleather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for\nrecording spells.\nSpyglass. Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.\nTent. A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.\nTinderbox. This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.\nTorch. A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.\nAdventuring Gear\nItem\nCost\nWeight\nAbacus\n2 gp\n2 lb.\nAcid (vial)\n25 gp\n1 lb.\nAlchemist’s fire (flask)\n50 gp\n1 lb.\nAmmunition\nArrows (20)\n1 gp\n1 lb.\nBlowgun needles (50)\n1 gp\n1 lb.\nCrossbow bolts (20)\n1 gp\n1½ lb.\nSling bullets (20)\n4 cp\n1½ lb.\nAntitoxin (vial)\n50 gp\n—\nArcane focus\nCrystal\n10 gp\n1 lb.\nOrb\n20 gp\n3 lb.\nRod\n10 gp\n2 lb.\nStaff\n5 gp\n4 lb.\nWand\n10 gp\n1 lb.\nBackpack\n2 gp\n5 lb.\nBall bearings (bag of 1,000)\n1 gp\n2 lb.\nBarrel\n2 gp\n70 lb.\nBasket\n4 sp\n2 lb.\nBedroll\n1 gp\n7 lb.\nBell\n1 gp\n—\nBlanket\n5 sp\n3 lb.\nBlock and tackle\n1 gp\n5 lb.\nBook\n25 gp\n5 lb.\nBottle, glass\n2 gp\n2 lb.\nBucket\n5 cp\n2 lb.\nCaltrops (bag of 20)\n1 gp\n2 lb.\nCandle\n1 cp\n—\nCase, crossbow bolt\n1 gp\n1 lb.\nCase, map or scroll\n1 gp\n1 lb.\nChain (10 feet)\n5 gp\n10 lb.\nChalk (1 piece)\n1 cp\n—\nChest\n5 gp\n25 lb.\nClimber’s kit\n25 gp\n12 lb.\nClothes, common\n5 sp\n3 lb.\nClothes, costume\n5 gp\n4 lb.\nClothes, fine\n15 gp\n6 lb.\nClothes, traveler’s\n2 gp\n4 lb.\nComponent pouch\n25 gp\n2 lb.\nCrowbar\n2 gp\n5 lb.\nDruidic focus\nSprig of mistletoe\n1 gp\n—\nTotem\n1 gp\n—\nWooden staff\n5 gp\n4 lb.\nYew wand\n10 gp\n1 lb.\nFishing tackle\n1 gp\n4 lb.\nFlask or tankard\n2 cp\n1 lb.\nGrappling hook\n2 gp\n4 lb.\nHammer\n1 gp\n3 lb.\nHammer, sledge\n2 gp\n10 lb.\nHealer’s kit\n5 gp\n3 lb.\nHoly symbol\nAmulet\n5 gp\n1 lb.\nEmblem\n5 gp\n—\nReliquary\n5 gp\n2 lb.\nHoly water (flask)\n25 gp\n1 lb.\nHourglass\n25 gp\n1 lb.\nHunting trap\n5 gp\n25 lb.\nInk (1 ounce bottle)\n10 gp\n—\nInk pen\n2 cp\n—\nJug or pitcher\n2 cp\n4 lb.\nLadder (10-foot)\n1 sp\n25 lb.\nLamp\n5 sp\n1 lb.\nLantern, bullseye\n10 gp\n2 lb.\nLantern, hooded\n5 gp\n2 lb.\nLock\n10 gp\n1 lb.\nMagnifying glass\n100 gp\n—\nManacles\n2 gp\n6 lb.\nMess kit\n2 sp\n1 lb.\nMirror, steel\n5 gp\n½ lb.\nOil (flask)\n1 sp\n1 lb.\nPaper (one sheet)\n2 sp\n—\nParchment (one sheet)\n1 sp\n—\nPerfume (vial)\n5 gp\n—\nPick, miner’s\n2 gp\n10 lb.\nPiton\n5 cp\n¼ lb.\nPoison, basic (vial)\n100 gp\n—\nPole (10-foot)\n5 cp\n7 lb.\nPot, iron\n2 gp\n10 lb.\nPotion of healing\n50 gp\n½ lb.\nPouch\n5 sp\n1 lb.\nQuiver\n1 gp\n1 lb.\nRam, portable\n4 gp\n35 lb.\nRations (1 day)\n5 sp\n2 lb.\nRobes\n1 gp\n4 lb.\nRope, hempen (50 feet)\n1 gp\n10 lb.\nRope, silk (50 feet)\n10 gp\n5 lb.\nSack\n1 cp\n½ lb.\nScale, merchant’s\n5 gp\n3 lb.\nSealing wax\n5 sp\n—\nShovel\n2 gp\n5 lb.\nSignal whistle\n5 cp\n—\nSignet ring\n5 gp\n—\nSoap\n2 cp\n—\nSpellbook\n50 gp\n3 lb.\nSpikes, iron (10)\n1 gp\n5 lb.\nSpyglass\n1,000 gp\n1 lb.\nTent, two-person\n2 gp\n20 lb.\nTinderbox\n5 sp\n1 lb.\nTorch\n1 cp\n1 lb.\nVial\n1 gp\n—\nWaterskin\n2 sp\n5 lb.

    "text": "Tools\nTools\nA tool helps you to do something you couldn’t otherwise do, such as craft or repair an item, forge a document, or pick a lock. Your race, class, background, or feats give you proficiency with certain tools. Proficiency with a tool allows you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make using that tool. Tool use is not tied to a single ability, since proficiency with a tool represents broader knowledge of its use. For example, the GM might ask you to make a Dexterity check to carve a fine detail with your woodcarver’s tools, or a Strength check to make something out of particularly hard wood.\nArtisan’s Tools. These special tools include the items needed to pursue a craft or trade. The table shows examples of the most common types of tools, each providing items related to a single craft. Proficiency with a set of artisan’s tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make using the tools in your craft. Each type of artisan’s tools requires a separate proficiency.\nDisguise Kit. This pouch of cosmetics, hair dye, and small props lets you create disguises that change your physical appearance. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a visual disguise.\nForgery Kit. This small box contains a variety of papers and parchments, pens and inks, seals and sealing wax, gold and silver leaf, and other supplies necessary to create convincing forgeries of physical documents. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to create a physical forgery of a document.\nGaming Set. This item encompasses a wide range of game pieces, including dice and decks of cards (for games such as Three-Dragon Ante). A few common examples appear on the Tools table, but other kinds of gaming sets exist. If you are proficient with a gaming set, you can add your proficiency bonus to ability checks you make to play a game with that set. Each type of gaming set requires a separate proficiency.\nHerbalism Kit. This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and potions of healing.\nMusical Instrument. Several of the most common types of musical instruments are shown on the table as examples. If you have proficiency with a given musical instrument, you can add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to play music with the instrument. A bard can use a musical instrument as a spellcasting focus. Each type of musical instrument requires a separate proficiency.\nNavigator’s Tools. This set of instruments is used for navigation at sea. Proficiency with navigator’s tools lets you chart a ship’s course and follow navigation charts. In addition, these tools allow you to add your proficiency bonus to any ability check you make to avoid getting lost at sea.\nPoisoner’s Kit. A poisoner’s kit includes the vials, chemicals, and other equipment necessary for the creation of poisons. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to craft or use poisons.\nThieves’ Tools. This set of tools includes a small file, a set of lock picks, a small mirror mounted on a metal handle, a set of narrow-bladed scissors, and a pair of pliers.  Proficiency with these tools lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to disarm traps or open locks\nTools\nItem\nCost\nWeight\nArtisan’s tools\nAlchemist’s supplies\n50 gp\n8 lb.\nBrewer’s supplies\n20 gp\n9 lb.\nCalligrapher’s supplies\n10 gp\n5 lb.\nCarpenter’s tools\n8 gp\n6 lb.\nCartographer’s tools\n15 gp\n6 lb.\nCobbler’s tools\n5 gp\n5 lb.\nCook’s utensils\n1 gp\n8 lb.\nGlassblower’s tools\n30 gp\n5 lb.\nJeweler’s tools\n25 gp\n2 lb.\nLeatherworker’s tools\n5 gp\n5 lb.\nMason’s tools\n10 gp\n8 lb.\nPainter’s supplies\n10 gp\n5 lb.\nPotter’s tools\n10 gp\n3 lb.\nSmith’s tools\n20 gp\n8 lb.\nTinker’s tools\n50 gp\n10 lb.\nWeaver’s tools\n1 gp\n5 lb.\nWoodcarver’s tools\n1 gp\n5 lb.\nDisguise kit\n25 gp\n3 lb.\nForgery kit\n15 gp\n5 lb.\nGaming set\nDice set\n1 sp\n—\nPlaying card set\n5 sp\n—\nHerbalism kit\n5 gp\n3 lb.\nMusical instrument\nBagpipes\n30 gp\n6 lb.\nDrum\n6 gp\n3 lb.\nDulcimer\n25 gp\n10 lb.\nFlute\n2 gp\n1 lb.\nLute\n35 gp\n2 lb.\nLyre\n30 gp\n2 lb.\nHorn\n3 gp\n2 lb.\nPan flute\n12 gp\n2 lb.\nShawm\n2 gp\n1 lb.\nViol\n30 gp\n1 lb.\nNavigator’s tools\n25 gp\n2 lb.\nPoisoner’s kit\n50 gp\n2 lb.\nThieves’ tools\n25 gp\n1 lb.\nVehicles (land or water)\n*\n*\n* See the Mounts and Vehicles section."

    "text": "Mounts and Vehicles\nMounts and Vehicles\nA good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness,\nbut its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise\nslow you down. The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each\nanimal’s speed and base carrying capacity.\nAn animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move\nweight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the\nweight of the vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle,\nthey can add their carrying capacity together.\nMounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming\nworlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase.\nThese include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and\nsimilar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for\nexample). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and\nraising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful\nentity, or negotiating with the mount itself.\nBarding. Barding is armor designed to protect an animal’s head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.\nSaddles. A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle.

    "text": "Expenses\nExpenses\nWhen not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins\nfor lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness,\nadventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical\nworld, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance,\nand clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost\nmore than others.\nLifestyle Expenses\nLifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.\nAt the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle.  The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.\nYour lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.\nLifestyle Expenses\nLifestyle\nPrice/Day\nWretched\n—\nSqualid\n1 sp\nPoor\n2 sp\nModest\n1 gp\nComfortable\n2 gp\nWealthy\n4 gp\nAristocratic\n≥10 gp\nWretched. You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers.  Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.\nSqualid. You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.\nPoor. A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.\nModest. A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple.  You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.\nComfortable. Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment.  You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.\nWealthy. Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.\nAristocratic. You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community.  You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.\nSelf-Sufficiency\nThe expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are\nspending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself\nof whatever services you can afford—paying for food and\nshelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your\narmor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend\ntheir time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the\nwild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.\nMaintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend\nany coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between\nadventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent\nof a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you\nlive at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.\nFood, Drink, and Lodging\nThe Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food\nitems and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in\nyour total lifestyle expenses.\nFood, Drink, and Lodging\nItem\nCost\nAle\nGallon\n2 sp\nMug\n4 cp\nBanquet (per person)\n10 gp\nBread, loaf\n2 cp\nCheese, hunk\n1 sp\nInn stay (per day)\nSqualid\n7 cp\nPoor\n1 sp\nModest\n5 sp\nComfortable\n8 sp\nWealthy\n2 gp\nAristocratic\n4 gp\nMeals (per day)\nSqualid\n3 cp\nPoor\n6 cp\nModest\n3 sp\nComfortable\n5 sp\nWealthy\n8 sp\nAristocratic\n2 gp\nMeat, chunk\n3 sp\nWine\nCommon (pitcher)\n2 sp\nFine (bottle)\n10 gp\nServices\nAdventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on\ntheir behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have\nfairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art,\nand a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.\nSome of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services\ntable. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of\npeople who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay\nthem to perform a specific task. For example, a\nwizard might pay a carpenter to\nconstruct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in\nthe secret\nchest spell. A fighter might\ncommission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A\nbard might pay a tailor to make\nexquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.\nOther hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary\nsoldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are\nhirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore.\nIf a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he\nor she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the\nplace, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the\nstables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that\nincludes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the\noffered compensation.\nServices\nService\nPay\nCoach cab\nBetween towns\n3 cp per mile\nWithin a city\n1 cp\nHireling\nSkilled\n2 gp per day\nUntrained\n2 sp per day\nMessenger\n2 cp per mile\nRoad or gate toll\n1 cp\nShip’s passage\n1 sp per mile\nSkilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that\ninvolves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a\nmercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum;\nsome expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are\nhired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can\ninclude laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.\nSpellcasting Services\nPeople who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of\nordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to\ncast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy\nand no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level\nof the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast\nit and the more it costs.\nHiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd\nlevel, such as\ncure wounds or\nidentify, is easy\nenough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus\nthe cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able\nand willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to\na large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple.\nOnce found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of\npayment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide,\nsuch as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing\na monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a\ndistant settlement."

    ],
    "text": "Feats\nCharacter Options\nAlignment\nA typical creature in the game world has an alignment, which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus, nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations.\nThese brief summaries of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.\nLawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected by society. Gold dragons, paladins, and most dwarves are lawful good.\nNeutral good (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many celestials, some cloud giants, and most gnomes are neutral good.\nChaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons, many elves, and unicorns are chaotic good.\nLawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance with law, tradition, or personal codes. Many monks and some wizards are lawful neutral.\nNeutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear of moral questions and don’t take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Lizardfolk, most druids, and many humans are neutral.\nChaotic neutral (CN) creatures follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many barbarians and rogues, and some bards, are chaotic neutral.\nLawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils, blue dragons, and hobgoblins are lawful evil.\nNeutral evil (NE) is the alignment of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms. Many drow, some cloud giants, and goblins are neutral evil.\nChaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons, red dragons, and orcs are chaotic evil.\nAlignment in the Multiverse\nFor many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery.\nThe evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the orc gods, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an orc chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. (Even half-orcs feel the lingering pull of the orc god’s influence.)\nAlignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn’t tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil.\nMost creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments—they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment.\nLanguages\nYour race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet.\nChoose your languages from the Standard Languages table, or choose one that is common in your campaign. With your GM’s permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves’ cant or the tongue of druids.\nSome of these languages are actually families of languages with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran, Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.\nStandard Languages\nLanguage\nTypical Speakers\nScript\nCommon\nHumans\nCommon\nDwarvish\nDwarves\nDwarvish\nElvish\nElves\nElvish\nGiant\nOgres, giants\nDwarvish\nGnomish\nGnomes\nDwarvish\nGoblin\nGoblinoids\nDwarvish\nHalfling\nHalflings\nCommon\nOrc\nOrcs\nDwarvish\nExotic Languages\nLanguage\nTypical Speakers\nScript\nAbyssal\nDemons\nInfernal\nCelestial\nCelestials\nCelestial\nDraconic\nDragons, dragonborn\nDraconic\nDeep Speech\nAboleths, cloakers\n—\nInfernal\nDevils\nInfernal\nPrimordial\nElementals\nDwarvish\nSylvan\nFey creatures\nElvish\nUndercommon\nUnderworld traders\nElvish\nInspiration\nInspiration is a rule the game master can use to reward you for playing your character in a way that’s true to his or her personality traits, ideal, bond, and flaw. By using inspiration, you can draw on your personality trait of compassion for the downtrodden to give you an edge in negotiating with the Beggar Prince. Or inspiration can let you call on your bond to the defense of your home village to push past the effect of a spell that has been laid on you.\nGaining Inspiration\nYour GM can choose to give you inspiration for a variety of reasons.  Typically, GMs award it when you play out your personality traits, give in to the drawbacks presented by a flaw or bond, and otherwise portray your character in a compelling way. Your GM will tell you how you can earn inspiration in the game.\nYou either have inspiration or you don’t—you can’t stockpile multiple inspirations for later use.\nUsing Inspiration\nIf you have inspiration, you can expend it when you make an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check. Spending your inspiration gives you advantage on that roll.\nAdditionally, if you have inspiration, you can reward another player for good roleplaying, clever thinking, or simply doing something exciting in the game. When another player character does something that really contributes to the story in a fun and interesting way, you can give up your inspiration to give that character inspiration."

    "text": "Feats\nBackgrounds\nEvery story has a beginning. Your character’s background reveals\nwhere you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in\nthe world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a\ngrizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan.\nYour rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded\naudiences as a jester.\nChoosing a background provides you with important story cues about\nyour character’s identity. The most important question to ask about\nyour background is what changed? Why did you stop doing\nwhatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did\nyou get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come\nfrom a wealthy background, why don’t you have more money? How did\nyou learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from\nordinary people who share your background?\nThe sample backgrounds in this chapter provide both concrete\nbenefits (features, proficiencies, and languages) and roleplaying\nsuggestions.\nProficiencies\nEach background gives a character proficiency in two skills\n(described in Using Ability\nScores).\nIn addition, most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one\nor more tools (detailed in\nEquipment).\nIf a character would gain the same proficiency from two different\nsources, he or she can choose a different proficiency of the same\nkind (skill or tool) instead.\nLanguages\nSome backgrounds also allow characters to learn additional languages\nbeyond those given by race. See\nLanguages.\nEquipment\nEach background provides a package of starting equipment. If you use\nthe optional rule to spend coin on gear, you do not receive the\nstarting equipment from your background.\nSuggested Characteristics\nA background contains suggested personal characteristics based on\nyour background. You can pick characteristics, roll dice to\ndetermine them randomly, or use the suggestions as inspiration for\ncharacteristics of your own creation.\nCustomizing a Background\nYou might want to tweak some of the features of a background so it\nbetter fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a\nbackground, you can replace one feature with any other one, choose\nany two skills, and choose a total of two tool proficiencies or\nlanguages from the sample backgrounds. You can either use the\nequipment package from your background or spend coin on gear as\ndescribed in the equipment section. (If you spend coin, you can’t\nalso take the equipment package suggested for your class.) Finally,\nchoose two personality traits, one ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If\nyou can’t find a feature that matches your desired background, work\nwith your GM to create one.\nAcolyte\nYou have spent your life in the service of a temple to a specific\ngod or pantheon of gods. You act as an intermediary between the\nrealm of the holy and the mortal world, performing sacred rites and\noffering sacrifices in order to conduct worshipers into the presence\nof the divine. You are not necessarily a cleric—performing\nsacred rites is not the same thing as channeling divine power.\nChoose a god, a pantheon of gods, or some other quasi-divine being\nfrom among those listed in\nFantasy-Historical\nPantheons or those specified by your GM, and work with your\nGM to detail the nature of your religious service. Were you a lesser\nfunctionary in a temple, raised from childhood to assist the priests\nin the sacred rites? Or were you a high priest who suddenly\nexperienced a call to serve your god in a different way? Perhaps you\nwere the leader of a small cult outside of any established temple\nstructure, or even an occult group that served a fiendish master\nthat you now deny.\nSkill Proficiencies: Insight, Religion\nLanguages: Two of your choice\nEquipment: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you entered\nthe priesthood), a prayer book or prayer wheel, 5 sticks of\nincense, vestments, a set of common clothes, and a pouch\ncontaining 15 gp\nFeature: Shelter of the Faithful\nAs an acolyte, you command the respect of those who share your\nfaith, and you can perform the religious ceremonies of your deity.\nYou and your adventuring companions can expect to receive free\nhealing and care at a temple, shrine, or other established presence\nof your faith, though you must provide any material components\nneeded for spells. Those who share your religion will support you\n(but only you) at a modest lifestyle.\nYou might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your\nchosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could\nbe the temple where you used to serve, if you remain on good terms\nwith it, or a temple where you have found a new home. While near\nyour temple, you can call upon the priests for assistance, provided\nthe assistance you ask for is not hazardous and you remain in good\nstanding with your temple.\nSuggested Characteristics\nAcolytes are shaped by their experience in temples or other\nreligious communities. Their study of the history and tenets of\ntheir faith and their relationships to temples, shrines, or\nhierarchies affect their mannerisms and ideals. Their flaws might be\nsome hidden hypocrisy or heretical idea, or an ideal or bond taken\nto an extreme.\nd8\nPersonality Trait\n1\nI idolize a particular hero of my faith, and constantly refer\nto that person’s deeds and example.\n2\nI can find common ground between the fiercest enemies,\nempathizing with them and always working toward peace.\n3\nI see omens in every event and action. The gods try to speak\nto us, we just need to listen.\n4\nNothing can shake my optimistic attitude.\n5\nI quote (or misquote) sacred texts and proverbs in almost\nevery situation.\n6\nI am tolerant (or intolerant) of other faiths and respect (or\ncondemn) the worship of other gods.\n7\nI’ve enjoyed fine food, drink, and high society among my\ntemple’s elite. Rough living grates on me.\n8\nI’ve spent so long in the temple that I have little practical\nexperience dealing with people in the outside world.\nd6\nIdeal\n1\nTradition. The ancient traditions of worship and sacrifice\nmust be preserved and upheld. (Lawful)\n2\nCharity. I always try to help those in need, no matter what\nthe personal cost. (Good)\n3\nChange. We must help bring about the changes the gods are\nconstantly working in the world. (Chaotic)\n4\nPower. I hope to one day rise to the top of my faith’s\nreligious hierarchy. (Lawful)\n5\nFaith. I trust that my deity will guide my actions. I have\nfaith that if I work hard, things will go well. (Lawful)\n6\nAspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god’s favor by\nmatching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any)\nd6\nBond\n1\nI would die to recover an ancient relic of my faith that was\nlost long ago.\n2\nI will someday get revenge on the corrupt temple hierarchy who\nbranded me a heretic.\n3\nI owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents\ndied.\n4\nEverything I do is for the common people.\n5\nI will do anything to protect the temple where I served.\n6\nI seek to preserve a sacred text that my enemies consider\nheretical and seek to destroy.\nd6\nFlaw\n1\nI judge others harshly, and myself even more severely.\n2\nI put too much trust in those who wield power within my\ntemple’s hierarchy.\n3\nI owe my life to the priest who took me in when my parents\ndied.\n4\nI am inflexible in my thinking.\n5\nI will do anything to protect the temple where I served.\n6\nOnce I pick a goal, I become obsessed with it to the detriment\nof everything else in my life."

Doing\nso lets you mix the abilities of those classes to realize a\ncharacter concept that might not be reflected in one of the standard\nclass options.\nWith this rule, you have the option of gaining a level in a new\nclass whenever you advance in level, instead of gaining a level in\nyour current class. Your levels in all your classes are added\ntogether to determine your character level. For example, if you have\nthree levels in wizard and two in fighter, you’re a 5th level\ncharacter.\nAs you advance in levels, you might primarily remain a member of\nyour original class with just a few levels in another class, or you\nmight change course entirely, never looking back at the class you\nleft behind.

Compared to a single class character of the same level,\nyou’ll sacrifice some focus in exchange for versatility.\nPrerequisites\nTo qualify for a new class, you must meet the ability score\nprerequisites for both your current class and your new one, as shown\nin the Multiclassing Prerequisites table.

Without the full\ntraining that a beginning character receives, you must be a quick\nstudy in your new class, having a natural aptitude that is reflected\nby higher than average ability scores.\nMulticlassing Prerequisites\nClass\nAbility Score Minimum\nBarbarian\nStrength 13\nBard\nCharisma 13\nCleric\nWisdom 13\nDruid\nWisdom 13\nFighter\nStrength 13 or Dexterity 13\nMonk\nDexterity 13 and Wisdom 13\nPaladin\nStrength 13 and Charisma 13\nRanger\nDexterity 13 and Wisdom 13\nRogue\nDexterity 13\nSorcerer\nCharisma 13\nWarlock\nCharisma 13\nWizard\nIntelligence 13\nExperience Points\nThe experience point cost to gain a level is always based on your\ntotal character level, as shown in the Character Advancement table,\nnot your level in a particular class. So, if you are a cleric\n6/fighter 1, you must gain enough XP to reach 8th level before you\ncan take your second level as a fighter or your seventh level as a\ncleric.\nHit Points and Hit Dice\nYou gain the hit points from your new class as described for levels\nafter 1st. You gain the 1st level hit points for a class only when\nyou are a 1st level character.\nYou add together the Hit Dice granted by all your classes to form\nyour pool of Hit Dice. If the Hit Dice are the same die type, you\ncan simply pool them together. For example, both the fighter and the\npaladin have a d10, so if you are a paladin 5/fighter 5, you have\nten d10 Hit Dice. If your classes give you Hit Dice of different\ntypes, keep track of them separately. If you are a paladin 5/cleric\n5, for example, you have five d10 Hit Dice and five d8 Hit Dice.\nProficiency Bonus\nYour proficiency bonus is always based on your total character\nlevel, as shown in the Character Advancement table in chapter 1, not\nyour level in a particular class. For example, if you are a fighter\n3/rogue 2, you have the proficiency bonus of a 5th level character,\nwhich is +3.\nProficiencies\nWhen you gain your first level in a class other than your initial\nclass, you gain only some of new class’s starting proficiencies, as\nshown in the Multiclassing Proficiencies table.\nMulticlassing Proficiencies\nClass\nProficiencies Gained\nBarbarian\nShields, simple weapons, martial weapons\nBard\nLight armor, one skill of your choice, one musical instrument\nof your choice\nCleric\nLight armor, medium armor, shields\nDruid\nLight armor, medium armor, shields (druids will not wear armor\nor use shields made of metal)\nFighter\nLight armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial\nweapons\nMonk\nSimple weapons, shortswords\nPaladin\nLight armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial\nweapons\nRanger\nLight armor, medium armor, shields, simple weapons, martial\nweapons, one skill from the class’s skill list\nRogue\nLight armor, one skill from the class’s skill list, thieves’\ntools\nSorcerer\n—\nWarlock\nLight armor, simple weapons\nWizard\n—\nClass Features\nWhen you gain a new level in a class, you get its features for that\nlevel. You don’t, however, receive the class’s starting equipment,\nand a few features have additional rules when you’re multiclassing:\nChannel Divinity, Extra Attack, Unarmored Defense, and Spellcasting.\nChannel Divinity\nIf you already have the Channel Divinity feature and gain a level in\na class that also grants the feature, you gain the Channel Divinity\neffects granted by that class, but getting the feature again doesn’t\ngive you an additional use of it. You gain additional uses only when\nyou reach a class level that explicitly grants them to you. For\nexample, if you are a cleric 6/paladin 4, you can use Channel\nDivinity twice between rests because you are high enough level in\nthe cleric class to have more uses. Whenever you use the feature,\nyou can choose any of the Channel Divinity effects available to you\nfrom your two classes.\nExtra Attack\nIf you gain the Extra Attack class feature from more than one class,\nthe features don’t add together. You can’t make more than two\nattacks with this feature unless it says you do (as the fighter’s\nversion of Extra Attack does). Similarly, the warlock’s eldritch\ninvocation Thirsting Blade doesn’t give you additional attacks if\nyou also have Extra Attack.\nUnarmored Defense\nIf you already have the Unarmored Defense feature, you can’t gain it\nagain from another class.\nSpellcasting\nYour capacity for spellcasting depends partly on your combined\nlevels in all your spellcasting classes and partly on your\nindividual levels in those classes. Once you have the Spellcasting\nfeature from more than one class, use the rules below. If you\nmulticlass but have the Spellcasting feature from only one class,\nyou follow the rules as described in that class.\nSpells Known and Prepared. You determine what spells you know\nand can prepare for each class individually, as if you were a single\nclassed member of that class. If you are a ranger 4/wizard 3, for\nexample, you know three 1st level ranger spells based on your levels\nin the ranger class. As 3rd level wizard, you know three wizard\ncantrips, and your spellbook contains ten wizard spells, two of\nwhich (the two you gained when you reached 3rd level as a wizard)\ncan be 2nd level spells. If your Intelligence is 16, you can prepare\nsix wizard spells from your spellbook.\nEach spell you know and prepare is associated with one of your\nclasses, and you use the spellcasting ability of that class when you\ncast the spell. Similarly, a spellcasting focus, such as a holy\nsymbol, can be used only for the spells from the class associated\nwith that focus.\nSpell Slots. You determine your available spell slots by\nadding together all your levels in the bard, cleric, druid,\nsorcerer, and wizard classes, and half your levels (rounded down) in\nthe paladin and ranger classes. Use this total to determine your\nspell slots by consulting the Multiclass Spellcaster table.\nIf you have more than one spellcasting class, this table might give\nyou spell slots of a level that is higher than the spells you know\nor can prepare. You can use those slots, but only to cast your lower\nlevel spells. If a lower level spell that you cast, like burning\nhands, has an enhanced effect when cast using a higher level slot,\nyou can use the enhanced effect, even though you don’t have any\nspells of that higher level.\nFor example, if you are the aforementioned ranger 4/wizard 3, you\ncount as a 5th level character when determining your spell slots:\nyou have four 1st level slots, three 2nd level slots, and two 3rd\nlevel slots. However, you don’t know any 3rd level spells, nor do\nyou know any 2nd level ranger spells. You can use the spell slots of\nthose levels to cast the spells you do know—and potentially\nenhance their effects.\nPact Magic. If you have both the Spellcasting class feature\nand the Pact Magic class feature from the warlock class, you can use\nthe spell slots you gain from the Pact Magic feature to cast spells\nyou know or have prepared from classes with the Spellcasting class\nfeature, and you can use the spell slots you gain from the\nSpellcasting class feature to cast warlock spells you know.\nMulticlass Spellcaster: Spell Slots per Spell Level\nLvl.\n1st\n2nd\n3rd\n4th\n5th\n6th\n7th\n8th\n9th\n1st\n2\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n2nd\n3\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n3rd\n4\n2\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n4th\n4\n3\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n5th\n4\n3\n2\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n6th\n4\n3\n3\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n7th\n4\n3\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n8th\n4\n3\n3\n2\n—\n—\n—\n—\n—\n9th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n1\n—\n—\n—\n—\n10th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n—\n—\n—\n—\n11th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n—\n—\n—\n12th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n—\n—\n—\n13th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n—\n—\n14th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n—\n—\n15th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n—\n16th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n—\n17th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n18th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n3\n1\n1\n1\n1\n19th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n3\n2\n1\n1\n1\n20th\n4\n3\n3\n3\n3\n2\n2\n1\n1"

An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature’s training and competence in activities related to that ability.\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from −5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\nAbility Scores and Modifiers\nScore\nModifier\n1\n−5\n2–3\n−4\n4–5\n−3\n6–7\n−2\n8–9\n−1\n10–11\n+0\n12–13\n+1\n14–15\n+2\n16–17\n+3\n18–19\n+4\n20–21\n+5\n22–23\n+6\n24–25\n+7\n26–27\n+8\n28–29\n+9\n30\n+10\nTo determine an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round down).\nBecause ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check, and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated scores."

    "text": "Advantage and Disadvantage\nAdvantage and Disadvantage\nSometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.\nIf multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.\nIf circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.\nWhen you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s Lucky trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.\nYou usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result."

    "text": "Proficiency Bonus\nProficiency Bonus\nCharacters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks.  The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.\nYour proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.\nOccasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s Expertise feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.\nBy the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.\nIn general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws.

    "text": "Ability Checks\nAbility Checks\nAn ability check tests a character’s or monster’s innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.\nFor every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.\nTypical Difficulty Classes\nTask Difficulty\nDC\nVery easy\n5\nEasy\n10\nMedium\n15\nHard\n20\nVery hard\n25\nNearly impossible\n30\nTo make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it’s a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.\nContests\nSometimes one character’s or monster’s efforts are directly opposed\nto another’s. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal—for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.\nBoth participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.\nIf the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.\nSkills\nEach ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual’s proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character’s starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster’s skill proficiencies appear in the monster’s stat block.)\nFor example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character’s attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.\nThe skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability’s description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.\nStrength\nAthletics\nDexterity\nAcrobatics\nSleight of Hand\nStealth\nIntelligence\nArcana\nHistory\nInvestigation\nNature\nReligion\nWisdom\nAnimal Handling\nInsight\nMedicine\nPerception\nSurvival\nCharisma\nDeception\nIntimidation\nPerformance\nPersuasion\nSometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, Make a Wisdom (Perception) check. At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.\nFor example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character’s proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.\nVariant: Skills with Different Abilities\nNormally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far.  In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you’re proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.\nPassive Checks\nA passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn’t involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.\nHere’s how to determine a character’s total for a passive check:\n10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check\nIf the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a score.\nFor example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.\nThe rules on hiding in the Dexterity section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.\nWorking Together\nSometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who’s leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.\nA character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves’ tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can’t help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.\nGroup Checks\nWhen a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren’t.\nTo make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.\nGroup checks don’t come up very often, and they’re most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment.  If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards."

    "text": "Using Each Ability\nUsing Each Ability\nEvery task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.\nStrength\nStrength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.\nStrength Checks\nA Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.\nAthletics. Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:\nYou attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.\nYou try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.\nYou struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.\nOther Strength Checks. The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nForce open a stuck, locked, or barred door\nBreak free of bonds\nPush through a tunnel that is too small\nHang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it\nTip over a statue\nKeep a boulder from rolling\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in hand-to-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.\nLifting and Carrying\nYour Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.\nCarrying Capacity. Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don’t usually have to worry about it.\nPush, Drag, or Lift. You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.\nSize and Strength. Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature’s carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.\nVariant: Encumbrance\nThe rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are encumbered, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.\nIf you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead heavily encumbered, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.\nDexterity\nDexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.\nDexterity Checks\nA Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.\nAcrobatics. Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you’re trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship’s deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.\nSleight of Hand. Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person’s pocket.\nStealth. Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.\nOther Dexterity Checks. The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nControl a heavily laden cart on a steep descent\nSteer a chariot around a tight turn\nPick a lock\nDisable a trap\nSecurely tie up a prisoner\nWriggle free of bonds\nPlay a stringed instrument\nCraft a small or detailed object\nAttack Rolls and Damage\nYou add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.\nArmor Class\nDepending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.\nInitiative\nAt the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures’ turns in combat.\nHiding\nThe GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check’s total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.\nYou can’t hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.\nAn invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet. In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.\nPassive Perception. When you hide, there’s a chance someone will notice you even if they aren’t searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature’s Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.\nWhat Can You See? One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be lightly or heavily obscured, as explained in chapter 8, Adventuring.\nConstitution\nConstitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.\nConstitution Checks\nConstitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.\nThe GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nHold your breath\nMarch or labor for hours without rest\nGo without sleep\nSurvive without food or water\nQuaff an entire stein of ale in one go\nHit Points\nYour Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points.  Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.\nIf your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level.  For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you’re 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.\nIntelligence\nIntelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.\nIntelligence Checks\nAn Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.\nArcana. Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.\nHistory. Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.\nInvestigation. When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nNature. Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.\nReligion. Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.\nOther Intelligence Checks. The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nCommunicate with a creature without using words\nEstimate the value of a precious item\nPull together a disguise to pass as a city guard\nForge a document\nRecall lore about a craft or trade\nWin a game of skill\nSpellcasting Ability\nWizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nWisdom\nWisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.\nWisdom Checks\nA Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone’s feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight,\nMedicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.\nAnimal Handling. When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal’s intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.\nInsight. Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone’s next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.\nMedicine. A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.\nPerception. Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something.  It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.\nSurvival. The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.\nOther Wisdom Checks. The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nGet a gut feeling about what course of action to follow\nDiscern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead\nSpellcasting Ability\nClerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.\nCharisma\nCharisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others.  It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.\nCharisma Checks\nA Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.\nDeception. Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fast-talk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone’s suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.\nIntimidation. When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.\nPerformance. Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.\nPersuasion. When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check.  Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette.  Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.\nOther Charisma Checks. The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:\nFind the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip\nBlend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation\nSpellcasting Ability\nBards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast."

    "text": "Saving Throws\nSaving Throws\nA saving throw—also called a save—represents an attempt to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat.  You don’t normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.\nTo make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.\nA saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.\nEach class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard, for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies, proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving throw proficiencies as well.\nThe Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed by a spell is determined by the caster’s spellcasting ability and proficiency bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect."

    "text": "Movement\nMovement\nSwimming across a rushing river, sneaking down a dungeon corridor,\nscaling a treacherous mountain slope—all sorts of movement\nplay a key role in fantasy gaming adventures.\nThe GM can summarize the adventurers’ movement without calculating\nexact distances or travel times: You travel through the forest\nand find the dungeon entrance late in the evening of the third\nday. Even in a dungeon, particularly a large dungeon or a cave\nnetwork, the GM can summarize movement between encounters: After\nkilling the guardian at the entrance to the ancient dwarven\nstronghold, you consult your map, which leads you through miles of\nechoing corridors to a chasm bridged by a narrow stone arch.\nSometimes it’s important, though, to know how long it takes to get\nfrom one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or\nminutes. The rules for determining travel time depend on two\nfactors: the speed and travel pace of the creatures moving and the\nterrain they’re moving over.\nSpeed\nEvery character and monster has a speed, which is the distance in\nfeet that the character or monster can walk in 1 round. This number\nassumes short bursts of energetic movement in the midst of a\nlife-threatening situation.\nThe following rules determine how far a character or monster can move in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nTravel Pace\nWhile traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to search an area more carefully.\nForced March. The Travel Pace table assumes that characters travel for 8 hours in day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of exhaustion.\nFor each additional hour of travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of exhaustion (see appendix A).\nMounts and Vehicles. For short spans of time (up to an hour), many animals move much faster than humanoids. A mounted character can ride at a gallop for about an hour, covering twice the usual distance for a fast pace. If fresh mounts are available every 8 to 10 miles, characters can cover larger distances at this pace, but this is very rare except in densely populated areas.\nCharacters in wagons, carriages, or other land vehicles choose a pace as normal. Characters in a waterborne vessel are limited to the speed of the vessel, and they don’t suffer penalties for a fast pace or gain benefits from a slow pace. Depending on the vessel and the size of the crew, ships might be able to travel for up to 24 hours per day.\nCertain special mounts, such as a pegasus or griffon, or special vehicles, such as a carpet of flying, allow you to travel more swiftly.\nTravel Pace\nPace\nDistance traveled per…\nMinute\nHour\nDay\nEffect\nFast\n400 feet\n4 miles\n30 miles\n−5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores\nNormal\n300 feet\n3 miles\n24 miles\n—\nSlow\n200 feet\n2 miles\n18 miles\nAble to use stealth\nDifficult Terrain\nThe travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively\nsimple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But\nadventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps,\nrubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered\nground—all considered difficult terrain.\nYou move at half speed in difficult terrain—moving 1 foot in\ndifficult terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only\nhalf the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.\nSpecial Types of Movement\nMovement through dangerous dungeons or wilderness areas often\ninvolves more than simply walking. Adventurers might have to climb,\ncrawl, swim, or jump to get where they need to go.\nClimbing, Swimming, and Crawling\nWhile climbing or swimming, each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult terrain), unless a creature has a climbing or swimming speed. At the GM’s option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.\nJumping\nYour Strength determines how far you can jump.\nLong Jump. When you make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement.\nThis rule assumes that the height of your jump doesn’t matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your GM’s option, you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle (no taller than a quarter of the jump’s distance), such as a hedge or low wall. Otherwise, you hit it.\nWhen you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land prone.\nHigh Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier if you move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump, you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your GM might allow you to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.\nYou can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1½ times your height."

    "text": "The Environment\nThe Environment\nBy its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark, dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment in such places.\nFalling\nA fall from a great height is one of the most common hazards facing an adventurer. At the end of a fall, a creature takes 1d6 bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it fell, to a maximum of 20d6.  The creature lands prone, unless it avoids taking damage from the fall.\nSuffocating\nA creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1 + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).\nWhen a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit points and is dying, and it can’t regain hit points or be stabilized until it can breathe again.\nFor example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach air before it drops to 0 hit points.\nVision and Light\nThe most fundamental tasks of adventuring—noticing danger, finding hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just a few—rely heavily on a character’s ability to see. Darkness and other effects that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.\nA given area might be lightly or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog, or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.\nA heavily obscured area—such as darkness, opaque fog, or dense foliage—blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers from the blinded condition (see appendix A) when trying to see something in that area.\nThe presence or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination: bright light, dim light, and darkness.\nBright light lets most creatures see normally. Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other sources of illumination within a specific radius.\nDim light, also called shadows, creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant full moon might bathe the land in dim light.\nDarkness creates a heavily obscured area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights), within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area of magical darkness.\nBlindsight\nA creature with blindsight can perceive its surroundings without relying on sight, within a specific radius. Creatures without eyes, such as oozes, and creatures with echolocation or heightened senses, such as bats and true dragons, have this sense.\nDarkvision\nMany creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision can see in darkness as if the darkness were dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature is concerned. However, the creature can’t discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.\nTruesight\nA creature with truesight can, out to a specific range, see in normal and magical darkness, see invisible creatures and objects, automatically detect visual illusions and succeed on saving throws against them, and perceives the original form of a shapechanger or a creature that is transformed by magic. Furthermore, the creature can see into the Ethereal Plane.\nFood and Water\nCharacters who don’t eat or drink suffer the effects of exhaustion (see appendix A). Exhaustion caused by lack of food or water can’t be removed until the character eats and drinks the full required amount.\nFood\nA character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.\nA character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of exhaustion.\nA normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.\nWater\nA character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.\nIf the character already has one or more levels of exhaustion, the character takes two levels in either case.\nInteracting with Objects\nA character’s interaction with objects in an environment is often simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the GM that his or her character is doing something, such as moving a lever, and the GM describes what, if anything, happens.\nFor example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character might need to force it. In such a situation, the GM might call for a Strength check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The GM sets the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.\nCharacters can also damage objects with their weapons and spells.  Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical attacks much like creatures can. The GM determines an object’s Armor Class and hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity to certain kinds of attacks. (It’s hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.) Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune to effects that require other saves. When an object drops to 0 hit points, it breaks.\nA character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The GM sets the DC for any such check."

They need rest—time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.\nAdventurers can take short rests in the midst of an adventuring day and a long rest to end the day.\nShort Rest\nA short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during\nwhich a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking,\nreading, and tending to wounds.\nA character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short\nrest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is\nequal to the character’s level.

    "text": "Between Adventures\nBetween Adventures\nBetween trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing research, or spending their hard-earned gold.\nIn some cases, the passage of time is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a new adventure, the GM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been doing. At other times, the GM might want to keep track of just how much time is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.\nLifestyle Expenses\nBetween adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay the cost of maintaining that lifestyle.\nLiving a particular lifestyle doesn’t have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles of the city than if you live in poverty.\nDowntime Activities\nBetween adventures, the GM might ask you what your character is doing during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.\nDowntime activities other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss it with your GM.\nCrafting\nYou can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan’s tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith’s tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.\nFor every day of downtime you spend crafting, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value. If something you want to craft has a market value greater than 5 gp, you make progress every day in 5-gp increments until you reach the market value of the item. For example, a suit of plate armor (market value 1,500 gp) takes 300 days to craft by yourself.\nMultiple characters can combine their efforts toward the crafting of a single item, provided that the characters all have proficiency with the requisite tools and are working together in the same place.  Each character contributes 5 gp worth of effort for every day spent helping to craft the item. For example, three characters with the requisite tool proficiency and the proper facilities can craft a suit of plate armor in 100 days, at a total cost of 750 gp.\nWhile crafting, you can maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day, or a comfortable lifestyle at half the normal cost.\nPracticing a Profession\nYou can work between adventures, allowing you to maintain a modest lifestyle without having to pay 1 gp per day. This benefit lasts as long you continue to practice your profession.\nIf you are a member of an organization that can provide gainful employment, such as a temple or a thieves’ guild, you earn enough to support a comfortable lifestyle instead.\nIf you have proficiency in the Performance skill and put your performance skill to use during your downtime, you earn enough to support a wealthy lifestyle instead.\nRecuperating\nYou can use downtime between adventures to recover from a debilitating injury, disease, or poison. After three days of downtime spent recuperating, you can make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, you can choose one of the following results:\nEnd one effect on you that prevents you from regaining hit points.\nFor the next 24 hours, gain advantage on saving throws against one disease or poison currently affecting you.\nResearching\nThe time between adventures is a great chance to perform research, gaining insight into mysteries that have unfurled over the course of the campaign. Research can include poring over dusty tomes and crumbling scrolls in a library or buying drinks for the locals to pry rumors and gossip from their lips.\nWhen you begin your research, the GM determines whether the information is available, how many days of downtime it will take to find it, and whether there are any restrictions on your research (such as needing to seek out a specific individual, tome, or location). The GM might also require you to make one or more ability checks, such as an Intelligence (Investigation) check to find clues pointing toward the information you seek, or a Charisma (Persuasion) check to secure someone’s aid. Once those conditions are met, you learn the information if it is available.\nFor each day of research, you must spend 1 gp to cover your expenses. This cost is in addition to your normal lifestyle expenses.\nTraining\nYou can spend time between adventures learning a new language or training with a set of tools. Your GM might allow additional training options.\nFirst, you must find an instructor willing to teach you. The GM determines how long it takes, and whether one or more ability checks are required.\nThe training lasts for 250 days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool."

    ],
    "text": "Movement and Position\nMovement and Position\nIn combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.\nOn your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.\nYour movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.\nBreaking Up Your Move\nYou can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.\nMoving between Attacks\nIf you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.\nUsing Different Speeds\nIf you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.\nFor example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.\nDifficult Terrain\nCombat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains.  Boulder-strewn caverns, briar-choked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.\nEvery foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.\nLow furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.\nBeing Prone\nCombatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are prone, a condition described in appendix A.\nYou can drop prone without using any of your speed.  Standing up takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.\nTo move while prone, you must crawl or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.\nInteracting with Objects Around You\nHere are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:\ndraw or sheathe a sword\nopen or close a door\nwithdraw a potion from your backpack\npick up a dropped axe\ntake a bauble from a table\nremove a ring from your finger\nstuff some food into your mouth\nplant a banner in the ground\nfish a few coins from your belt pouch\ndrink all the ale in a flagon\nthrow a lever or a switch\npull a torch from a sconce\ntake a book from a shelf you can reach\nextinguish a small flame\ndon a mask\npull the hood of your cloak up and over your head\nput your ear to a door\nkick a small stone\nturn a key in a lock\ntap the floor with a 10-foot pole\nhand an item to another character\nMoving Around Other Creatures\nYou can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.\nWhether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.\nIf you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack, as explained later in the chapter.\nFlying Movement\nFlying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the fly spell.\nCreature Size\nEach creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.\nSize Categories\nSize\nSpace\nTiny\n2½ by 2½ ft.\nSmall\n5 by 5 ft.\nMedium\n5 by 5 ft.\nLarge\n10 by 10 ft.\nHuge\n15 by 15 ft.\nGargantuan\n20 by 20 ft. or larger\nSpace\nA creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5-foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.\nA creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.\nBecause larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.\nSqueezing into a Smaller Space\nA creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space."

    "text": "Combat\nActions in Combat\nWhen you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.\nWhen you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.\nAttack\nThe most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.\nWith this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the Making an Attack section for the rules that govern attacks.\nCertain features, such as the Extra Attack feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.\nCast a Spell\nSpellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat.  Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action.  Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.\nDash\nWhen you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the\ncurrent turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any\nmodifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to\n60 feet on your turn if you dash.\nAny increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional\nmovement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to\n15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you\ndash.\nDisengage\nIf you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of\nthe turn.\nDodge\nWhen you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding\nattacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made\nagainst you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you\nmake Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit\nif you are incapacitated\n(as explained in appendix A) or if your speed drops to 0.\nHelp\nYou can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a\ntask. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains\nadvantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you\nare helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start\nof your next turn.\nAlternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a\ncreature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in\nsome other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If\nyour ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack\nroll is made with advantage.\nHide\nWhen you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the Unseen Attackers and Targets section later in this chapter.\nReady\nSometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.\nFirst, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it, and If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.\nWhen the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.\nWhen you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the web spell and ready magic missile, your web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release magic missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.\nSearch\nWhen you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.\nUse an Object\nYou normally interact with an object while doing something else,\nsuch as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object\nrequires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action.\nThis action is also useful when you want to interact with more than\none object on your turn."

    "text": "Combat\nMaking an Attack\nWhether you’re striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.\nChoose a target. Pick a target within your attack’s range: a creature, an object, or a location.\nDetermine modifiers. The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.\nResolve the attack. You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.\nIf there’s ever any question whether something you’re doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you’re making an attack roll, you’re making an attack.\nAttack Rolls\nWhen you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the\nattack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add\nthe appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers\nequals or exceeds the target’s Armor Class (AC), the attack hits.\nThe AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas\nthe AC of a monster is in its stat block.\nModifiers to the Roll\nWhen a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character’s proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.\nAbility Modifier. The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.\nSome spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used\nfor a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the\nspellcaster.\nProficiency Bonus. You add your proficiency bonus to your\nattack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have\nproficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.\nRolling 1 or 20\nSometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to\nhit and the veteran to miss.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of\nany modifiers or the target’s AC. This is called a critical hit, which is explained later in\nthis chapter.\nIf the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless\nof any modifiers or the target’s AC.\nUnseen Attackers and Targets\nCombatants often try to escape their foes’ notice by\nhiding, casting the\ninvisibility\nspell, or lurking in\ndarkness.\nWhen you attack a target that you can’t see, you have\ndisadvantage on the attack\nroll. This is true whether you’re guessing the target’s location or\nyou’re targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target\nisn’t in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the\nGM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you\nguessed the target’s location correctly.\nWhen a creature can’t see you, you have\nadvantage on attack rolls\nagainst it. If you are hidden—both unseen and\nunheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location\nwhen the attack hits or misses.\nRanged Attacks\nWhen you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a\nhandaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a\ndistance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells\nalso involve making a ranged attack.\nRange\nYou can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.\nIf a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can’t attack a target beyond this range.\nSome ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can’t attack a target beyond the long range.\nRanged Attacks in Close Combat\nAiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you.  When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn’t incapacitated.\nMelee Attacks\nUsed in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you\nto attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a\nhandheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical\nmonster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns,\nteeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve\nmaking a melee attack.\nMost creatures have a 5-foot reach and can thus attack targets\nwithin 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures\n(typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a\ngreater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.\nInstead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use\nan unarmed strike: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar\nforceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed\nstrike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier.\nYou are proficient with your unarmed strikes.\nOpportunity Attacks\nIn a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike\nan enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an\nopportunity attack.\nYou can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.\nYou can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don’t provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don’t provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe’s reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.\nTwo-Weapon Fighting\nWhen you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you’re holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you’re holding in the other hand. You don’t add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.\nIf either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.\nContests in Combat\nBattle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe.\nSuch a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes\nthe most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling\nand shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for\nimprovising others.\nGrappling\nWhen you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).\nEscaping a Grapple. A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.\nMoving a Grappled Creature. When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.\nShoving a Creature\nUsing the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.\nThe target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you."

A target can\nbenefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on\nthe opposite side of the cover.\nThere are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple\nsources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies;\nthe degrees aren’t added together. For example, if a target is\nbehind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives\nthree-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters\ncover.\nA target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity\nsaving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at\nleast half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large\npiece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that\ncreature is an enemy or a friend.\nA target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC\nand Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover\nif about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The\nobstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree\ntrunk.\nA target with total cover can’t be targeted directly by an\nattack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by\nincluding it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is\ncompletely concealed by an obstacle."

    "text": "Combat\nDamage and Healing\nInjury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.\nHit Points\nHit points represent a combination of physical and mental\ndurability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit\npoints are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are\nmore fragile.\nA creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can\nbe any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This\nnumber changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives\nhealing.\nWhenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its\nhit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s\ncapabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.\nDamage Rolls\nEach weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage\nit deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and\napply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities,\nand other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is\npossible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.\nWhen attacking with a weapon, you add your ability\nmodifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to\nthe damage. A spell tells you which dice to roll for damage\nand whether to add any modifiers.\nIf a spell or other effect deals damage to more than one\ntarget at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them.\nFor example, when a wizard casts fireball or a cleric casts flame\nstrike, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught\nin the blast.\nCritical Hits\nWhen you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.\nFor example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.\nDamage Types\nDifferent attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal\ndifferent types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own,\nbut other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.\nThe damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage\ntype to a new effect.\nAcid. The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the\ndissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.\nBludgeoning. Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling,\nconstriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.\nCold. The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear\nand the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.\nFire. Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure\nflames to deal fire damage.\nForce. Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging\nform. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including\nmagic missile\nand spiritual\nweapon.\nLightning. A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath\ndeal lightning damage.\nNecrotic. Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a\nspell such as chill\ntouch, withers matter and even the soul.\nPiercing. Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears\nand monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.\nPoison. Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s\nbreath deal poison damage.\nPsychic. Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic\nblast deal psychic damage.\nRadiant. Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s\nflame strike\nspell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and\noverloads the spirit with power.\nSlashing. Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing\ndamage.\nThunder. A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of\nthe thunderwave\nspell, deals thunder damage.\nDamage Resistance and Vulnerability\nSome creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually\neasy to hurt with certain types of damage.\nIf a creature or an object has resistance to a damage type, damage\nof that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has\nvulnerability to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled\nagainst it.\nResistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other\nmodifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to\nbludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning\ndamage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all\ndamage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so\nthe creature takes 10 damage.\nMultiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the\nsame damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a\ncreature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all\nnonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by\nhalf against the creature, not reduced by three-quarters.\nHealing\nUnless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a cure wounds spell or a potion of healing can remove damage in an instant.\nWhen a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.\nA creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the revivify spell has restored it to life.\nDropping to 0 Hit Points\nWhen you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.\nInstant Death\nMassive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.\nFor example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.\nFalling Unconscious\nIf damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall unconscious (see appendix A). This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.\nDeath Saving Throws\nWhenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.\nRoll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.\nRolling 1 or 20. When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.\nDamage at 0 Hit Points. If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.\nStabilizing a Creature\nThe best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.\nYou can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.\nA stable creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.\nMonsters and Death\nMost GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.\nMighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.\nKnocking a Creature Out\nSometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.\nTemporary Hit Points\nSome spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.\nWhen you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.\nBecause temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.\nHealing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.\nIf you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.\nUnless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest."

Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can’t mount it if you don’t have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.\nIf an effect moves your mount against its will while you’re on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you’re knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.\nIf your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.\nControlling a Mount\nWhile you’re mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.\nYou can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge.  A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.\nAn independent mount retains its place in the initiative order.  Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.\nIn either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you’re on it, the attacker can target you or the mount."

Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin (including a spear, trident, or dart).\nCreatures and objects that are fully immersed in water have resistance to fire damage."

    ],
    "text": "What Is a Spell?\nWhat Is a Spell?\nA spell is a discrete magical effect, a single shaping of the\nmagical energies that suffuse the multiverse into a specific,\nlimited expression. In casting a spell, a character carefully plucks\nat the invisible strands of raw magic suffusing the world, pins them\nin place in a particular pattern, sets them vibrating in a specific\nway, and then releases them to unleash the desired effect—in\nmost cases, all in the span of seconds.\nSpells can be versatile tools, weapons, or protective wards. They\ncan deal damage or undo it, impose or remove conditions (see\nappendix A), drain life energy away,\nand restore life to the dead.\nUncounted thousands of spells have been created over the course of\nthe multiverse’s history, and many of them are long forgotten. Some\nmight yet lie recorded in crumbling spellbooks hidden in ancient\nruins or trapped in the minds of dead gods. Or they might someday be\nreinvented by a character who has amassed enough power and wisdom to\ndo so.\nSpell Level\nEvery spell has a level from 0 to 9. A spell’s level is a general\nindicator of how powerful it is, with the lowly (but still\nimpressive) magic\nmissile at 1st level and the earth-shaking\nwish at 9th.\nCantrips—simple but powerful spells that characters can cast\nalmost by rote—are level 0. The higher a spell’s level, the\nhigher level a spellcaster must be to use that spell.\nSpell level and character level don’t correspond directly.\nTypically, a character has to be at least 17th level, not 9th level,\nto cast a 9th-level spell.\nKnown and Prepared Spells\nBefore a spellcaster can use a spell, he or she must have the spell firmly fixed in mind, or must have access to the spell in a magic item. Members of a few classes, including bards and sorcerers, have a limited list of spells they know that are always fixed in mind.  The same thing is true of many magic-using monsters. Other spellcasters, such as clerics and wizards, undergo a process of preparing spells. This process varies for different classes, as detailed in their descriptions.\nIn every case, the number of spells a caster can have fixed in mind at any given time depends on the character’s level.\nSpell Slots\nRegardless of how many spells a caster knows or prepares, he or she can cast only a limited number of spells before resting.  Manipulating the fabric of magic and channeling its energy into even a simple spell is physically and mentally taxing, and higher-level spells are even more so. Thus, each spellcasting class’s description (except that of the warlock) includes a table showing how many spell slots of each spell level a character can use at each character level. For example, the 3rd-level wizard Umara has four 1st-level spell slots and two 2nd-level slots.\nWhen a character casts a spell, he or she expends a slot of that\nspell’s level or higher, effectively filling a slot with the\nspell. You can think of a spell slot as a groove of a certain\nsize—small for a 1st-level slot, larger for a spell of\nhigher level. A 1st-level spell fits into a slot of any size,\nbut a 9th-level spell fits only in a 9th-level slot. So\nwhen Umara casts magic missile, a 1st-level spell, she spends\none of her four 1st-level slots and has three remaining.\nFinishing a long rest\nrestores any expended spell slots.\nSome characters and monsters have special abilities that let them\ncast spells without using spell slots. For example, a monk who\nfollows the Way of the Four Elements, a warlock who chooses certain\neldritch invocations, and a pit fiend from the Nine Hells can all\ncast spells in such a way.\nCasting a Spell at a Higher Level\nWhen a spellcaster casts a spell using a slot that is of a higher\nlevel than the spell, the spell assumes the higher level for that\ncasting. For instance, if Umara casts magic missile\nusing one of her 2nd-level slots, that magic missile is\n2nd level. Effectively, the spell expands to fill the slot it is put\ninto.\nSome spells, such as magic missile and cure wounds, have\nmore powerful effects when cast at a higher level, as detailed in a\nspell’s description.\nCasting in Armor\nBecause of the mental focus and precise gestures required for\nspellcasting, you must be proficient with the armor you are wearing\nto cast a spell. You are otherwise too distracted and physically\nhampered by your armor for spellcasting.\nCantrips\nA cantrip is a spell that can be cast at will, without using a spell\nslot and without being prepared in advance. Repeated practice has\nfixed the spell in the caster’s mind and infused the caster with the\nmagic needed to produce the effect over and over. A cantrip’s spell\nlevel is 0.\nRituals\nCertain spells have a special tag: ritual. Such a spell can be cast following the normal rules for spellcasting, or the spell can be cast as a ritual. The ritual version of a spell takes 10 minutes longer to cast than normal. It also doesn’t expend a spell slot, which means the ritual version of a spell can’t be cast at a higher level.\nTo cast a spell as a ritual, a spellcaster must have a feature that grants the ability to do so. The cleric and the druid, for example, have such a feature. The caster must also have the spell prepared or on his or her list of spells known, unless the character’s ritual feature specifies otherwise, as the wizard’s does."

    "text": "Casting a Spell\nCasting a Spell\nWhen a character casts any spell, the same basic rules are followed, regardless of the character’s class or the spell’s effects.\nEach spell description begins with a block of information, including the spell’s name, level, school of magic, casting time, range, components, and duration. The rest of a spell entry describes the spell’s effect.\nCasting Time\nMost spells require a single action to cast, but some spells require a bonus action, a reaction, or much more time to cast.\nBonus Action\nA spell cast with a bonus action is especially swift. You must use a bonus action on your turn to cast the spell, provided that you haven’t already taken a bonus action this turn. You can’t cast another spell during the same turn, except for a cantrip with a casting time of 1 action.\nReactions\nSome spells can be cast as reactions. These spells take a fraction of a second to bring about and are cast in response to some event.  If a spell can be cast as a reaction, the spell description tells you exactly when you can do so.\nLonger Casting Times\nCertain spells (including spells cast as rituals) require more time to cast: minutes or even hours. When you cast a spell with a casting time longer than a single action or reaction, you must spend your action each turn casting the spell, and you must maintain your concentration while you do so (see Concentration below). If your concentration is broken, the spell fails, but you don’t expend a spell slot. If you want to try casting the spell again, you must start over.\nRange\nThe target of a spell must be within the spell’s range. For a spell like magic missile, the target is a creature. For a spell like fireball, the target is the point in space where the ball of fire erupts.\nMost spells have ranges expressed in feet. Some spells can target only a creature (including you) that you touch. Other spells, such as the shield spell, affect only you. These spells have a range of self.\nSpells that create cones or lines of effect that originate from you also have a range of self, indicating that the origin point of the spell’s effect must be you (see Areas of Effect later in the this chapter).\nOnce a spell is cast, its effects aren’t limited by its range, unless the spell’s description says otherwise.\nComponents\nA spell’s components are the physical requirements you must meet in order to cast it. Each spell’s description indicates whether it requires verbal (V), somatic (S), or material (M) components. If you can’t provide one or more of a spell’s components, you are unable to cast the spell.\nVerbal (V)\nMost spells require the chanting of mystic words. The words themselves aren’t the source of the spell’s power; rather, the particular combination of sounds, with specific pitch and resonance, sets the threads of magic in motion. Thus, a character who is gagged or in an area of silence, such as one created by the silence spell, can’t cast a spell with a verbal component.\nSomatic (S)\nSpellcasting gestures might include a forceful gesticulation or an intricate set of gestures. If a spell requires a somatic component, the caster must have free use of at least one hand to perform these gestures.\nMaterial (M)\nCasting some spells requires particular objects, specified in parentheses in the component entry. A character can use a component pouch or a spellcasting focus (found in Equipment) in place of the components specified for a spell. But if a cost is indicated for a component, a character must have that specific component before he or she can cast the spell.\nIf a spell states that a material component is consumed by the spell, the caster must provide this component for each casting of the spell.\nA spellcaster must have a hand free to access a spell’s material components—or to hold a spellcasting focus—but it can be the same hand that he or she uses to perform somatic components.\nDuration\nA spell’s duration is the length of time the spell persists. A duration can be expressed in rounds, minutes, hours, or even years.  Some spells specify that their effects last until the spells are dispelled or destroyed.\nInstantaneous\nMany spells are instantaneous. The spell harms, heals, creates, or alters a creature or an object in a way that can’t be dispelled, because its magic exists only for an instant.\nConcentration\nSome spells require you to maintain concentration in order to keep their magic active. If you lose concentration, such a spell ends.\nIf a spell must be maintained with concentration, that fact appears in its Duration entry, and the spell specifies how long you can concentrate on it. You can end concentration at any time (no action required).\nNormal activity, such as moving and attacking, doesn’t interfere with concentration. The following factors can break concentration:\nCasting another spell that requires concentration. You lose concentration on a spell if you cast another spell that requires concentration. You can’t concentrate on two spells at once.\nTaking damage. Whenever you take damage while you are concentrating on a spell, you must make a Constitution saving throw to maintain your concentration. The DC equals 10 or half the damage you take, whichever number is higher. If you take damage from multiple sources, such as an arrow and a dragon’s breath, you make a separate saving throw for each source of damage.\nBeing incapacitated or killed. You lose concentration on a spell if you are incapacitated or if you die.\nThe GM might also decide that certain environmental phenomena, such as a wave crashing over you while you’re on a storm-tossed ship, require you to succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw to maintain concentration on a spell.\nTargets\nA typical spell requires you to pick one or more targets to be affected by the spell’s magic. A spell’s description tells you whether the spell targets creatures, objects, or a point of origin for an area of effect (described below).\nUnless a spell has a perceptible effect, a creature might not know it was targeted by a spell at all. An effect like crackling lightning is obvious, but a more subtle effect, such as an attempt to read a creature’s thoughts, typically goes unnoticed, unless a spell says otherwise.\nA Clear Path to the Target\nTo target something, you must have a clear path to it, so it can’t be behind total cover.\nIf you place an area of effect at a point that you can’t see and an obstruction, such as a wall, is between you and that point, the point of origin comes into being on the near side of that obstruction.\nTargeting Yourself\nIf a spell targets a creature of your choice, you can choose yourself, unless the creature must be hostile or specifically a creature other than you. If you are in the area of effect of a spell you cast, you can target yourself.\nAreas of Effect\nSpells such as burning hands and cone of cold cover an area, allowing them to affect multiple creatures at once.\nA spell’s description specifies its area of effect, which typically has one of five different shapes: cone, cube, cylinder, line, or sphere. Every area of effect has a point of origin, a location from which the spell’s energy erupts. The rules for each shape specify how you position its point of origin.  Typically, a point of origin is a point in space, but some spells have an area whose origin is a creature or an object.\nA spell’s effect expands in straight lines from the point of origin.  If no unblocked straight line extends from the point of origin to a location within the area of effect, that location isn’t included in the spell’s area. To block one of these imaginary lines, an obstruction must provide total cover.\nCone\nA cone extends in a direction you choose from its point of origin. A cone’s width at a given point along its length is equal to that point’s distance from the point of origin. A cone’s area of effect specifies its maximum length.\nA cone’s point of origin is not included in the cone’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nCube\nYou select a cube’s point of origin, which lies anywhere on a face of the cubic effect. The cube’s size is expressed as the length of each side.\nA cube’s point of origin is not included in the cube’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nCylinder\nA cylinder’s point of origin is the center of a circle of a particular radius, as given in the spell description. The circle must either be on the ground or at the height of the spell effect.  The energy in a cylinder expands in straight lines from the point of origin to the perimeter of the circle, forming the base of the cylinder. The spell’s effect then shoots up from the base or down from the top, to a distance equal to the height of the cylinder.\nA cylinder’s point of origin is included in the cylinder’s area of effect.\nLine\nA line extends from its point of origin in a straight path up to its length and covers an area defined by its width.\nA line’s point of origin is not included in the line’s area of effect, unless you decide otherwise.\nSphere\nYou select a sphere’s point of origin, and the sphere extends outward from that point. The sphere’s size is expressed as a radius in feet that extends from the point.\nA sphere’s point of origin is included in the sphere’s area of effect.\nSaving Throws\nMany spells specify that a target can make a saving throw to avoid some or all of a spell’s effects. The spell specifies the ability that the target uses for the save and what happens on a success or failure.\nThe DC to resist one of your spells equals 8 + your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus + any special modifiers.\nAttack Rolls\nSome spells require the caster to make an attack roll to determine whether the spell effect hits the intended target. Your attack bonus with a spell attack equals your spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.\nMost spells that require attack rolls involve ranged attacks.  Remember that you have disadvantage on a ranged attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature that can see you and that isn’t incapacitated.\nThe Schools of Magic\nAcademies of magic group spells into eight categories called schools of magic. Scholars, particularly wizards, apply these categories to all spells, believing that all magic functions in essentially the same way, whether it derives from rigorous study or is bestowed by a deity.\nThe schools of magic help describe spells; they have no rules of their own, although some rules refer to the schools.\nAbjuration spells are protective in nature, though some of them have aggressive uses. They create magical barriers, negate harmful effects, harm trespassers, or banish creatures to other planes of existence.\nConjuration spells involve the transportation of objects and creatures from one location to another. Some spells summon creatures or objects to the caster’s side, whereas others allow the caster to teleport to another location. Some conjurations create objects or effects out of nothing.\nDivination spells reveal information, whether in the form of secrets long forgotten, glimpses of the future, the locations of hidden things, the truth behind illusions, or visions of distant people or places.\nEnchantment spells affect the minds of other see the caster as a friend, force creatures to take a course of action, or even control another creature like a puppet.\nEvocation spells manipulate magical energy to produce a desired effect. Some call up blasts of fire or lightning. Others channel positive energy to heal wounds.\nIllusion spells deceive the senses or minds of others. They cause people to see things that are not there, to miss things that are there, to hear phantom noises, or to remember things that never happened. Some illusions create phantom images that any creature can see, but the most insidious illusions plant an image directly in the mind of a creature.\nNecromancy spells manipulate the energies of life and death.  Such spells can grant an extra reserve of life force, drain the life energy from another creature, create the undead, or even bring the dead back to life. Creating the undead through the use of necromancy spells such as animate dead is not a good act, and only evil casters use such spells frequently.\nTransmutation spells change the properties of a creature, object, or environment. They might turn an enemy into a harmless creature, bolster the strength of an ally, make an object move at the caster’s command, or enhance a creature’s innate healing abilities to rapidly recover from injury.\nCombining Magical Effects\nThe effects of different spells add together while the durations of those spells overlap. The effects of the same spell cast multiple times don’t combine, however. Instead, the most potent effect—such as the highest bonus—from those castings applies while their durations overlap.\nFor example, if two clerics cast bless on the same target, that character gains the spell’s benefit only once; he or she doesn’t get to roll two bonus dice."

    "text": "Spells: A\nSpell Descriptions\nSpells: A\nAcid Arrow\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (powdered rhubarb leaf and an adder’s\nstomach)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and\nbursts in a spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the\ntarget. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and\n2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow\nsplashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage\nand no damage at the end of its next turn.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later)\nincreases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.\nAcid Splash\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or\nchoose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each\nother. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6\nacid damage.\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6),\n11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).\nAid\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYour spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose\nup to three creatures within range. Each target’s hit point maximum\nand current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points increase by an\nadditional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.\nAlarm\n1st-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a\nwindow, or an area within range that is no larger than a\n20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a\nTiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you\ncast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the\nalarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.\nA mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within\n1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are\nsleeping.\nAn audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds\nwithin 60 feet.\nAlter Self\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of\nthe following options, the effects of which last for the duration of\nthe spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an\naction to gain the benefits of a different one.\nAquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic\nenvironment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your\nfingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal\nto your walking speed.\nChange Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide\nwhat you look like, including your height, weight, facial features,\nsound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing\ncharacteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of\nanother race, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t\nappear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic\nshape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to\nbecome quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of\nthe spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this\nway again.\nNatural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a\ndifferent natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal\n1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the\nnatural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed\nstrikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1\nbonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.\nAnimal Messenger\n2nd-level enchantment (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a morsel of food)\nDuration: 24 hours\nBy means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message.\nChoose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a\nblue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have\nvisited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as\na man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard or\na red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat. You also speak a\nmessage of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the\nduration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about\n50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other\nanimals.\nWhen the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature\nthat you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The\nmessenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you\ngave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the\nspell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to\nwhere you cast this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48\nhours for each slot level above 2nd.\nAnimal Shapes\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 24 hours\nYour magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing\ncreatures that you can see within range. You transform each target\ninto the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of\n4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to\ntransform affected creatures into new forms.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until\nthe target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different\nform for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the\nstatistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its\nalignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target\nassumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its\nnormal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it\ntransformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points,\nany excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the\nexcess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit\npoints, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the\nactions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t\nspeak or cast spells.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t\nactivate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nAnimate Dead\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a\ncorpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues\nthe target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead\ncreature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a\nzombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game\nstatistics).\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally\ncommand any creature you made with this spell if the creature is\nwithin 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can\ncommand any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same\ncommand to each one). You decide what action the creature will take\nand where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a\ngeneral command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.\nIf you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against\nhostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to\nfollow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it\nstops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of\nthe creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the\ncreature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This\nuse of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures\nyou have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two\nadditional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of\nthe creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.\nAnimate Objects\n5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nObjects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical\nobjects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium\ntargets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects,\nHuge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object\nlarger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under\nyour control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.\nAs a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made\nwith this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you\ncontrol multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at\nthe same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide\nwhat action the creature will take and where it will move during its\nnext turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a\nparticular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the\ncreature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given\nan order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is\ncomplete.\nAnimated Object Statistics\nSize\nHP\nAC\nAttack\nStr\nDex\nTiny\n20\n18\n+8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage\n4\n18\nSmall\n25\n16\n+6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage\n6\n14\nMedium\n40\n13\n+5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage\n10\n12\nLarge\n50\n10\n+6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage\n14\n10\nHuge\n80\n10\n+8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage\n18\n6\nStrength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is\n10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its\nspeed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it\ncan use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and\ncan hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a\nlarger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It\nhas blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that\ndistance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts\nto its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over\nto its original object form.\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee\nattack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam\nattack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its\nsize. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or\npiercing damage based on its form.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for\neach slot level above 5th.\nAntilife Shell\n5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius\nand moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out\ncreatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for\nthe duration.\nThe barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching\nthrough. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with\nranged or reach weapons through the barrier.\nIf you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through\nthe barrier, the spell ends.\nAntimagic Field\n8th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds\nyou. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the\nmultiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned\ncreatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the\nspell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an\nartifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude\ninto it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed.\nWhile an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it\nspends suppressed counts against its duration.\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as\nmagic missile and\ncharm person, that target\na creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect,\nsuch as fireball, can’t extend\ninto the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part\nof the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For\nexample, the flames created by a\nwall of fire are\nsuppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the\noverlap is large enough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a\ncreature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature\nor object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work\nin the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the\ndeparture point for such magical travel. A portal to another\nlocation, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an\nextradimensional space such as that created by the\nrope trick spell,\ntemporarily closes while in the sphere.\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or\ncreated by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.\nSuch a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature\noccupied is no longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as\ndispel magic have no\neffect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different\nantimagic field spells don’t nullify each\nother.\nAntipathy/Sympathy\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)\nDuration: 10 days\nThis spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target\nsomething within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature\nor an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then\nspecify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons,\ngoblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either\nattracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose\nantipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.\nAntipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you\ndesignated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the\ntarget. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60\nfeet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or\nbecome frightened. The\ncreature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within\n60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use\nits movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t\nsee the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the\ntarget and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but\nthe creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the\ntarget or moves within 60 feet of it.\nSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to\nfeel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of\nit or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or\ncomes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom\nsaving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the\narea or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done\nso, it can’t willingly move away from the target.\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the\naffected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect,\nas described below.\nEnding the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn\nwhile not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the\ncreature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the\ncreature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the\nfeeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a\ncreature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving\nthrow every 24 hours while the spell persists.\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to\nit for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\nArcane Eye\n4th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the\nair for the duration.\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has\nnormal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in\nevery direction.\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction.\nThere is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it\ncan’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the\neye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as\n1 inch in diameter.\nArcane Hand\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin\nglove)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an\nunoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for\nthe spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the\nmovements of your own hand.\nThe hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your\nhit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It\nhas a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand\ndoesn’t fill its space.\nWhen you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent\nturns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the\nfollowing effects with it.\nClenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within\n5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game\nstatistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.\nForceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target.  If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\nGrasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller\ncreature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to\nresolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have\nadvantage on the check. While\nthe hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have\nthe hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning\ndamage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nInterposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and\na creature you choose until you give the hand a different command.\nThe hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you\nwith half cover against the target. The target can’t move through\nthe hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the\nhand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the\nhand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the\nhand’s space, but that space is\ndifficult terrain for\nthe target.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option\nincreases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by\n2d6 for each slot level above 5th.\nArcane Lock\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and\nit becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you\ndesignate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You\ncan also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the\nobject, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is\nimpassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or\nsuppressed. Casting knock on the\nobject suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.\nWhile affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break\nor force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases\nby 10.\nArcane Sword\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range.\nIt lasts for the duration.\nWhen the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a\ntarget of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the\ntarget takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a\nbonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet\nto a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target\nor a different one.\nArcanist’s Magic Aura\n2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a small square of silk)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that\ndivination spells reveal false information about it. The target can\nbe a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn\nby another creature.\nWhen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following\neffects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell\non the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the\nsame effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is\ndispelled.\nFalse Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells\nand magical effects, such as\ndetect magic, that detect\nmagical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a\nmagical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical\naura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that\nyou choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the\nfalse magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.\nMask. You change the way the target appears to spells and\nmagical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s\nDivine Sense or the trigger of a\nsymbol spell. You choose a\ncreature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target\nas if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.\nAstral Projection\n9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Special\nYou and up to eight willing creatures within range project your\nastral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting\nis wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you\nleave behind is\nunconscious and in a state\nof suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.\nYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way,\nreplicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal\ndifference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from\nbetween your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to\ninvisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material\nbody. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way\nhome. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when\nan effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body\nare separated, killing you instantly.\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can\npass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter\na new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this\nspell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver\ncord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.\nYour astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other\neffects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor\ndo they persist when you return to it.\nThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action\nto dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to\nits physical body, and it awakens.\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A\nsuccessful dispel magic\nspell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for\nthat creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form\ndrops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the\nspell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the\ncreature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of\nsuspended animation.\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain\nin their astral forms and must find their own way back to their\nbodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.\nAugury\n2nd-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBy casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out\nornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an\nomen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific\ncourse of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.\nThe GM chooses from the following possible omens:\nWeal, for good results\nWoe, for bad results\nWeal and woe, for both good and bad results\nNothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad\nThe spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that\nmight change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells\nor the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next\nlong rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting\nafter the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this\nroll in secret.\nAwaken\n5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 8 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAfter spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a\nprecious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The\ntarget must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of\n3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also\ngains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a\nplant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines,\ncreepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s.\nYour GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such\nas the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.\nThe awakened beast or plant is\ncharmed by you for 30 days or\nuntil you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the\ncharmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to\nremain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was\ncharmed."

Make a ranged spell attack against the\ntarget. On a hit, the target takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and\n2d4 acid damage at the end of its next turn. On a miss, the arrow\nsplashes the target with acid for half as much of the initial damage\nand no damage at the end of its next turn.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, the damage (both initial and later)\nincreases by 1d4 for each slot level above 2nd.\nAcid Splash\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hurl a bubble of acid. Choose one creature within range, or\nchoose two creatures within range that are within 5 feet of each\nother. A target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6\nacid damage.\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d6 when you reach 5th level (2d6),\n11th level (3d6), and 17th level (4d6).\nAid\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny strip of white cloth)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYour spell bolsters your allies with toughness and resolve. Choose\nup to three creatures within range. Each target’s hit point maximum\nand current hit points increase by 5 for the duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, a target’s hit points increase by an\nadditional 5 for each slot level above 2nd.\nAlarm\n1st-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny bell and a piece of fine silver wire)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou set an alarm against unwanted intrusion. Choose a door, a\nwindow, or an area within range that is no larger than a\n20-foot cube. Until the spell ends, an alarm alerts you whenever a\nTiny or larger creature touches or enters the warded area. When you\ncast the spell, you can designate creatures that won’t set off the\nalarm. You also choose whether the alarm is mental or audible.\nA mental alarm alerts you with a ping in your mind if you are within\n1 mile of the warded area. This ping awakens you if you are\nsleeping.\nAn audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell for 10 seconds\nwithin 60 feet.\nAlter Self\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou assume a different form. When you cast the spell, choose one of\nthe following options, the effects of which last for the duration of\nthe spell. While the spell lasts, you can end one option as an\naction to gain the benefits of a different one.\nAquatic Adaptation. You adapt your body to an aquatic\nenvironment, sprouting gills and growing webbing between your\nfingers. You can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal\nto your walking speed.\nChange Appearance. You transform your appearance. You decide\nwhat you look like, including your height, weight, facial features,\nsound of your voice, hair length, coloration, and distinguishing\ncharacteristics, if any. You can make yourself appear as a member of\nanother race, though none of your statistics change. You also can’t\nappear as a creature of a different size than you, and your basic\nshape stays the same; if you’re bipedal, you can’t use this spell to\nbecome quadrupedal, for instance. At any time for the duration of\nthe spell, you can use your action to change your appearance in this\nway again.\nNatural Weapons. You grow claws, fangs, spines, horns, or a\ndifferent natural weapon of your choice. Your unarmed strikes deal\n1d6 bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing damage, as appropriate to the\nnatural weapon you chose, and you are proficient with your unarmed\nstrikes. Finally, the natural weapon is magic and you have a +1\nbonus to the attack and damage rolls you make using it.\nAnimal Messenger\n2nd-level enchantment (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a morsel of food)\nDuration: 24 hours\nBy means of this spell, you use an animal to deliver a message.\nChoose a Tiny beast you can see within range, such as a squirrel, a\nblue jay, or a bat. You specify a location, which you must have\nvisited, and a recipient who matches a general description, such as\na man or woman dressed in the uniform of the town guard or\na red-haired dwarf wearing a pointed hat. You also speak a\nmessage of up to twenty-five words. The target beast travels for the\nduration of the spell toward the specified location, covering about\n50 miles per 24 hours for a flying messenger, or 25 miles for other\nanimals.\nWhen the messenger arrives, it delivers your message to the creature\nthat you described, replicating the sound of your voice. The\nmessenger speaks only to a creature matching the description you\ngave. If the messenger doesn’t reach its destination before the\nspell ends, the message is lost, and the beast makes its way back to\nwhere you cast this spell.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3nd level or higher, the duration of the spell increases by 48\nhours for each slot level above 2nd.\nAnimal Shapes\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 24 hours\nYour magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing\ncreatures that you can see within range. You transform each target\ninto the form of a Large or smaller beast with a challenge rating of\n4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you can use your action to\ntransform affected creatures into new forms.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration for each target, or until\nthe target drops to 0 hit points or dies. You can choose a different\nform for each target. A target’s game statistics are replaced by the\nstatistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains its\nalignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The target\nassumes the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its\nnormal form, it returns to the number of hit points it had before it\ntransformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points,\nany excess damage carries over to its normal form. As long as the\nexcess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal form to 0 hit\npoints, it isn’t knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the\nactions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t\nspeak or cast spells.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The target can’t\nactivate, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.\nAnimate Dead\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of blood, a piece of flesh, and a pinch of bone dust)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell creates an undead servant. Choose a pile of bones or a\ncorpse of a Medium or Small humanoid within range. Your spell imbues\nthe target with a foul mimicry of life, raising it as an undead\ncreature. The target becomes a skeleton if you chose bones or a\nzombie if you chose a corpse (the GM has the creature’s game\nstatistics).\nOn each of your turns, you can use a bonus action to mentally\ncommand any creature you made with this spell if the creature is\nwithin 60 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can\ncommand any or all of them at the same time, issuing the same\ncommand to each one). You decide what action the creature will take\nand where it will move during its next turn, or you can issue a\ngeneral command, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor.\nIf you issue no commands, the creature only defends itself against\nhostile creatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to\nfollow it until its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it\nstops obeying any command you’ve given it. To maintain control of\nthe creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the\ncreature again before the current 24-hour period ends. This\nuse of the spell reasserts your control over up to four creatures\nyou have animated with this spell, rather than animating a new one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, you animate or reassert control over two\nadditional undead creatures for each slot level above 3rd. Each of\nthe creatures must come from a different corpse or pile of bones.\nAnimate Objects\n5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nObjects come to life at your command. Choose up to ten nonmagical\nobjects within range that are not being worn or carried. Medium\ntargets count as two objects, Large targets count as four objects,\nHuge targets count as eight objects. You can’t animate any object\nlarger than Huge. Each target animates and becomes a creature under\nyour control until the spell ends or until reduced to 0 hit points.\nAs a bonus action, you can mentally command any creature you made\nwith this spell if the creature is within 500 feet of you (if you\ncontrol multiple creatures, you can command any or all of them at\nthe same time, issuing the same command to each one). You decide\nwhat action the creature will take and where it will move during its\nnext turn, or you can issue a general command, such as to guard a\nparticular chamber or corridor. If you issue no commands, the\ncreature only defends itself against hostile creatures. Once given\nan order, the creature continues to follow it until its task is\ncomplete.\nAnimated Object Statistics\nSize\nHP\nAC\nAttack\nStr\nDex\nTiny\n20\n18\n+8 to hit, 1d4 + 4 damage\n4\n18\nSmall\n25\n16\n+6 to hit, 1d8 + 2 damage\n6\n14\nMedium\n40\n13\n+5 to hit, 2d6 + 1 damage\n10\n12\nLarge\n50\n10\n+6 to hit, 2d10 + 2 damage\n14\n10\nHuge\n80\n10\n+8 to hit, 2d12 + 4 damage\n18\n6\nStrength, and Dexterity determined by its size. Its Constitution is\n10 and its Intelligence and Wisdom are 3, and its Charisma is 1. Its\nspeed is 30 feet; if the object lacks legs or other appendages it\ncan use for locomotion, it instead has a flying speed of 30 feet and\ncan hover. If the object is securely attached to a surface or a\nlarger object, such as a chain bolted to a wall, its speed is 0. It\nhas blindsight with a radius of 30 feet and is blind beyond that\ndistance. When the animated object drops to 0 hit points, it reverts\nto its original object form, and any remaining damage carries over\nto its original object form.\nIf you command an object to attack, it can make a single melee\nattack against a creature within 5 feet of it. It makes a slam\nattack with an attack bonus and bludgeoning damage determined by its\nsize. The GM might rule that a specific object inflicts slashing or\npiercing damage based on its form.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, you can animate two additional objects for\neach slot level above 5th.\nAntilife Shell\n5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA shimmering barrier extends out from you in a 10-foot radius\nand moves with you, remaining centered on you and hedging out\ncreatures other than undead and constructs. The barrier lasts for\nthe duration.\nThe barrier prevents an affected creature from passing or reaching\nthrough. An affected creature can cast spells or make attacks with\nranged or reach weapons through the barrier.\nIf you move so that an affected creature is forced to pass through\nthe barrier, the spell ends.\nAntimagic Field\n8th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot-radius sphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron or iron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds\nyou. This area is divorced from the magical energy that suffuses the\nmultiverse. Within the sphere, spells can’t be cast, summoned\ncreatures disappear, and even magic items become mundane. Until the\nspell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you.\nSpells and other magical effects, except those created by an\nartifact or a deity, are suppressed in the sphere and can’t protrude\ninto it. A slot expended to cast a suppressed spell is consumed.\nWhile an effect is suppressed, it doesn’t function, but the time it\nspends suppressed counts against its duration.\nTargeted Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as\nmagic missile and\ncharm person, that target\na creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.\nAreas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect,\nsuch as fireball, can’t extend\ninto the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the part\nof the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For\nexample, the flames created by a\nwall of fire are\nsuppressed within the sphere, creating a gap in the wall if the\noverlap is large enough.\nSpells. Any active spell or other magical effect on a\ncreature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the creature\nor object is in it.\nMagic Items. The properties and powers of magic items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere functions as a nonmagical longsword.\nA magic weapon’s properties and powers are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed as soon as it exits.\nMagical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to work\nin the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the\ndeparture point for such magical travel. A portal to another\nlocation, world, or plane of existence, as well as an opening to an\nextradimensional space such as that created by the\nrope trick spell,\ntemporarily closes while in the sphere.\nCreatures and Objects. A creature or object summoned or\ncreated by magic temporarily winks out of existence in the sphere.\nSuch a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature\noccupied is no longer within the sphere.\nDispel Magic. Spells and magical effects such as\ndispel magic have no\neffect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created by different\nantimagic field spells don’t nullify each\nother.\nAntipathy/Sympathy\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (either a lump of alum soaked in vinegar for the antipathy effect or a drop of honey for the sympathy effect)\nDuration: 10 days\nThis spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target\nsomething within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature\nor an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then\nspecify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons,\ngoblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either\nattracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose\nantipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.\nAntipathy. The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you\ndesignated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the\ntarget. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60\nfeet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or\nbecome frightened. The\ncreature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within\n60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use\nits movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t\nsee the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the\ntarget and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but\nthe creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the\ntarget or moves within 60 feet of it.\nSympathy. The enchantment causes the specified creatures to\nfeel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of\nit or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or\ncomes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom\nsaving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the\narea or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done\nso, it can’t willingly move away from the target.\nIf the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the\naffected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect,\nas described below.\nEnding the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn\nwhile not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the\ncreature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the\ncreature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the\nfeeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a\ncreature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving\nthrow every 24 hours while the spell persists.\nA creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to\nit for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.\nArcane Eye\n4th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of bat fur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou create an invisible, magical eye within range that hovers in the\nair for the duration.\nYou mentally receive visual information from the eye, which has\nnormal vision and darkvision out to 30 feet. The eye can look in\nevery direction.\nAs an action, you can move the eye up to 30 feet in any direction.\nThere is no limit to how far away from you the eye can move, but it\ncan’t enter another plane of existence. A solid barrier blocks the\neye’s movement, but the eye can pass through an opening as small as\n1 inch in diameter.\nArcane Hand\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an eggshell and a snakeskin\nglove)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an\nunoccupied space that you can see within range. The hand lasts for\nthe spell’s duration, and it moves at your command, mimicking the\nmovements of your own hand.\nThe hand is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your\nhit point maximum. If it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It\nhas a Strength of 26 (+8) and a Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand\ndoesn’t fill its space.\nWhen you cast the spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent\nturns, you can move the hand up to 60 feet and then cause one of the\nfollowing effects with it.\nClenched Fist. The hand strikes one creature or object within\n5 feet of it. Make a melee spell attack for the hand using your game\nstatistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8 force damage.\nForceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand’s Strength contested by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target.  If the target is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it.\nGrasping Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller\ncreature within 5 feet of it. You use the hand’s Strength score to\nresolve the grapple. If the target is Medium or smaller, you have\nadvantage on the check. While\nthe hand is grappling the target, you can use a bonus action to have\nthe hand crush it. When you do so, the target takes bludgeoning\ndamage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nInterposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and\na creature you choose until you give the hand a different command.\nThe hand moves to stay between you and the target, providing you\nwith half cover against the target. The target can’t move through\nthe hand’s space if its Strength score is less than or equal to the\nhand’s Strength score. If its Strength score is higher than the\nhand’s Strength score, the target can move toward you through the\nhand’s space, but that space is\ndifficult terrain for\nthe target.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, the damage from the clenched fist option\nincreases by 2d8 and the damage from the grasping hand increases by\n2d6 for each slot level above 5th.\nArcane Lock\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (gold dust worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and\nit becomes locked for the duration. You and the creatures you\ndesignate when you cast this spell can open the object normally. You\ncan also set a password that, when spoken within 5 feet of the\nobject, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it is\nimpassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or\nsuppressed. Casting knock on the\nobject suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes.\nWhile affected by this spell, the object is more difficult to break\nor force open; the DC to break it or pick any locks on it increases\nby 10.\nArcane Sword\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature platinum sword with a grip and pommel of copper and zinc, worth 250 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a sword-shaped plane of force that hovers within range.\nIt lasts for the duration.\nWhen the sword appears, you make a melee spell attack against a\ntarget of your choice within 5 feet of the sword. On a hit, the\ntarget takes 3d10 force damage. Until the spell ends, you can use a\nbonus action on each of your turns to move the sword up to 20 feet\nto a spot you can see and repeat this attack against the same target\nor a different one.\nArcanist’s Magic Aura\n2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a small square of silk)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that\ndivination spells reveal false information about it. The target can\nbe a willing creature or an object that isn’t being carried or worn\nby another creature.\nWhen you cast the spell, choose one or both of the following\neffects. The effect lasts for the duration. If you cast this spell\non the same creature or object every day for 30 days, placing the\nsame effect on it each time, the illusion lasts until it is\ndispelled.\nFalse Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells\nand magical effects, such as\ndetect magic, that detect\nmagical auras. You can make a nonmagical object appear magical, a\nmagical object appear nonmagical, or change the object’s magical\naura so that it appears to belong to a specific school of magic that\nyou choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can make the\nfalse magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.\nMask. You change the way the target appears to spells and\nmagical effects that detect creature types, such as a paladin’s\nDivine Sense or the trigger of a\nsymbol spell. You choose a\ncreature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target\nas if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment.\nAstral Projection\n9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (for each creature you affect with this spell, you must provide one jacinth worth at least 1,000 gp and one ornately carved bar of silver worth at least 100 gp, all of which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Special\nYou and up to eight willing creatures within range project your\nastral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting\nis wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you\nleave behind is\nunconscious and in a state\nof suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age.\nYour astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way,\nreplicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal\ndifference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from\nbetween your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to\ninvisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material\nbody. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way\nhome. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when\nan effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body\nare separated, killing you instantly.\nYour astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can\npass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter\na new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this\nspell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver\ncord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane.\nYour astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other\neffects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor\ndo they persist when you return to it.\nThe spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action\nto dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to\nits physical body, and it awakens.\nThe spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A\nsuccessful dispel magic\nspell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for\nthat creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form\ndrops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the\nspell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the\ncreature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of\nsuspended animation.\nIf you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain\nin their astral forms and must find their own way back to their\nbodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.\nAugury\n2nd-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (specially marked sticks, bones, or similar tokens worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBy casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out\nornate cards, or employing some other divining tool, you receive an\nomen from an otherworldly entity about the results of a specific\ncourse of action that you plan to take within the next 30 minutes.\nThe GM chooses from the following possible omens:\nWeal, for good results\nWoe, for bad results\nWeal and woe, for both good and bad results\nNothing, for results that aren’t especially good or bad\nThe spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that\nmight change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells\nor the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before completing your next\nlong rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting\nafter the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this\nroll in secret.\nAwaken\n5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 8 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an agate worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAfter spending the casting time tracing magical pathways within a\nprecious gemstone, you touch a Huge or smaller beast or plant. The\ntarget must have either no Intelligence score or an Intelligence of\n3 or less. The target gains an Intelligence of 10. The target also\ngains the ability to speak one language you know. If the target is a\nplant, it gains the ability to move its limbs, roots, vines,\ncreepers, and so forth, and it gains senses similar to a human’s.\nYour GM chooses statistics appropriate for the awakened plant, such\nas the statistics for the awakened shrub or the awakened tree.\nThe awakened beast or plant is\ncharmed by you for 30 days or\nuntil you or your companions do anything harmful to it. When the\ncharmed condition ends, the awakened creature chooses whether to\nremain friendly to you, based on how you treated it while it was\ncharmed."

While there, the\ntarget is incapacitated.\nThe target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the\ntarget reappears in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied\nspace if that space is occupied.\nIf the target is native to a different plane of existence than the\none you’re on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise,\nreturning to its home plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has\npassed, the target reappears in the space it left or in the nearest\nunoccupied space if that space is occupied. Otherwise, the target\ndoesn’t return.\nAt Higher Levels.

While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability\nchecks and saving throws made with that ability score.\nWhile cursed, the target has disadvantage on attack rolls\nagainst you.\nWhile cursed, the target must make a Wisdom saving throw at the\nstart of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action that\nturn doing nothing.\nWhile the target is cursed, your attacks and spells deal an extra\n1d8 necrotic damage to the target.\nA remove curse spell ends\nthis effect. At the GM’s option, you may choose an alternative curse\neffect, but it should be no more powerful than those described\nabove. The GM has final say on such a curse’s effect.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10\nminutes. If you use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, the\nduration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher,\nthe duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot, the\nspell lasts until it is dispelled.

At the\nstart of your next turn, and when the spell ends if you are on the\nEthereal Plane, you return to an unoccupied space of your choice\nthat you can see within 10 feet of the space you vanished from. If\nno unoccupied space is available within that range, you appear in\nthe nearest unoccupied space (chosen at random if more than one\nspace is equally near). You can dismiss this spell as an action.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can see and hear the plane you\noriginated from, which is cast in shades of gray, and you can’t see\nanything there more than 60 feet away.

The spell fails if you can’t see a point in the\nair where the storm cloud could appear (for example, if you are in a\nroom that can’t accommodate the cloud).\nWhen you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A\nbolt of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each\ncreature within 5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving\nthrow. A creature takes 3d10 lightning damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one. On each of your turns until\nthe spell ends, you can use your action to call down lightning in\nthis way again, targeting the same point or a different one.\nIf you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell,\nthe spell gives you control over the existing storm instead of\ncreating a new one. Under such conditions, the spell’s damage\nincreases by 1d10.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th or higher level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot\nlevel above 3rd.\nCalm Emotions\n2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each\nhumanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose\nwithin range must make a Charisma saving throw; a creature can\nchoose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails\nits saving throw, choose one of the following two effects.\nYou can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell\nends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has\nnot expired in the meantime.\nAlternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of\nyour choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the\ntarget is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of\nits friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes\nhostile again, unless the GM rules otherwise.\nChain Lightning\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fur; a piece of amber, glass, or a crystal rod; and three silver pins)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your\nchoice that you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from\nthat target to as many as three other targets, each of which must be\nwithin 30 feet of the first target. A target can be a creature or an\nobject and can be targeted by only one of the bolts.\nA target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8\nlightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a\nsuccessful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th level or higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first\ntarget to another target for each slot level above 6th.\nCharm Person\n1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must\nmake a Wisdom saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your\ncompanions are fighting it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell\nends or until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The\ncharmed creature regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the\nspell ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for\neach slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of\neach other when you target them.\nChill Touch\nNecromancy cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nYou create a ghostly, skeletal hand in the space of a creature\nwithin range. Make a ranged spell attack against the creature to\nassail it with the chill of the grave. On a hit, the target takes\n1d8 necrotic damage, and it can’t regain hit points until the start\nof your next turn. Until then, the hand clings to the target.\nIf you hit an undead target, it also has disadvantage on attack rolls\nagainst you until the end of your next turn.\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),\n11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nCircle of Death\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (the powder of a crushed black pearl worth at least 500 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA sphere of negative energy ripples out in a 60-foot-radius sphere\nfrom a point within range. Each creature in that area must make a\nConstitution saving throw. A target takes 8d6 necrotic damage on a\nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 2d6 for each slot\nlevel above 6th.\nClairvoyance\n3rd-level divination\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 1 mile\nComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 100 gp, either a jeweled horn for hearing or a glass eye for seeing)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar\nto you (a place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious\nlocation that is unfamiliar to you (such as behind a door, around a\ncorner, or in a grove of trees). The sensor remains in place for the\nduration, and it can’t be attacked or otherwise interacted with.\nWhen you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can use\nthe chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As\nyour action, you can switch between seeing and hearing.\nA creature that can see the sensor (such as a creature benefiting\nfrom see invisibility\nor truesight) sees a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your\nfist.\nClone\n8th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp and at least 1 cubic inch of flesh of the creature that is to be cloned, which the spell consumes, and a vessel worth at least 2,000 gp that has a sealable lid and is large enough to hold a Medium creature, such as a huge urn, coffin, mud-filled cyst in the ground, or crystal container filled with salt water)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a\nsafeguard against death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and\ngrows to full size and maturity after 120 days; you can also choose\nto have the clone be a younger version of the same creature. It\nremains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its vessel\nremains undisturbed.\nAt any time after the clone matures, if the original creature dies,\nits soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free and\nwilling to return. The clone is physically identical to the original\nand has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of\nthe original’s equipment. The original creature’s physical remains,\nif they still exist, become inert and can’t thereafter be restored\nto life, since the creature’s soul is elsewhere.\nCloudkill\n5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow-green fog\ncentered on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around\ncorners. It lasts for the duration or until strong wind disperses\nthe fog, ending the spell. Its area is heavily obscured. When a\ncreature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn or\nstarts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution saving\nthrow. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even\nif they hold their breath or don’t need to breathe.\nThe fog moves 10 feet away from you at the start of each of your\nturns, rolling along the surface of the ground. The vapors, being\nheavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even pouring\ndown openings.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 5th.\nColor Spray\n1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder or sand that is colored red, yellow, and blue)\nDuration: 1 round\nA dazzling array of flashing, colored light springs from your hand.\nRoll 6d10; the total is how many hit points of creatures this spell\ncan effect. Creatures in a 15-foot cone originating from you are\naffected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures and\ncreatures that can’t see). Starting with the creature that has the\nlowest current hit points, each creature affected by this spell is\nblinded until the spell ends.\nSubtract each creature’s hit points from the total before moving on\nto the creature with the next lowest hit points. A creature’s hit\npoints must be equal to or less than the remaining total for that\ncreature to be affected.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d10 for each slot level\nabove 1st.\nCommand\n1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 round\nYou speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range.\nThe target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the\ncommand on its next turn. The spell has no effect if the target is\nundead, if it doesn’t understand your language, or if your command\nis directly harmful to it.\nSome typical commands and their effects follow. You might issue a\ncommand other than one described here. If you do so, the GM\ndetermines how the target behaves. If the target can’t follow your\ncommand, the spell ends.\nApproach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and\nmost direct route, ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.\nDrop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends\nits turn.\nFlee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the\nfastest available means.\nGrovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.\nHalt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions. A flying\ncreature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so. If it must\nmove to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain\nin the air.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, you can affect one additional creature for\neach slot level above 1st. The creatures must be within 30 feet of\neach other when you target them.\nCommune\n5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and a vial of holy or unholy water)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three\nquestions that can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your\nquestions before the spell ends. You receive a correct answer for\neach question. Divine beings aren’t necessarily omniscient, so you\nmight receive unclear as an answer if a question pertains to\ninformation that lies beyond the deity’s knowledge. In a case where\na one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity’s\ninterests, the GM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next\nlong rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting\nafter the first that you get no answer. The GM makes this roll in\nsecret.\nCommune with Nature\n5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the\nsurrounding territory. In the outdoors, the spell gives you\nknowledge of the land within 3 miles of you. In caves and other\nnatural underground settings, the radius is limited to 300 feet. The\nspell doesn’t function where nature has been replaced by\nconstruction, such as in dungeons and towns.\nYou instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts of your choice\nabout any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:\nterrain and bodies of water\nprevalent plants, minerals, animals, or peoples\npowerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead\ninfluence from other planes of existence\nbuildings\nFor example, you could determine the location of powerful undead in\nthe area, the location of major sources of safe drinking water, and\nthe location of any nearby towns.\nComprehend Languages\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of soot and salt)\nDuration: 1 hour\nFor the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken\nlanguage that you hear.

Each creature in a 10-foot-radius\nsphere centered on a point you choose within range must succeed on a\nWisdom saving throw when you cast this spell or be affected by it.\nAn affected target can’t take reactions and must roll a d10 at the\nstart of each of its turns to determine its behavior for that turn.\nd10\nBehavior\n1\nThe creature uses all its movement to move in a random direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each die face. The creature doesn’t take an action this turn.\n2–6\nThe creature doesn’t move or take actions this turn.\n7–8\nThe creature uses its action to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach. If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.\n9–10\nThe creature can act and move normally.\nAt the end of each of its turns, an affected target can make a\nWisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect ends for that\ntarget.\nAt Higher Levels.

If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend\nthemselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.\nThe GM has the creatures’ statistics.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain\nhigher-level spell slots, you choose one of the summoning options\nabove, and more creatures appear: twice as many with a 5th-level\nslot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot, and four times as\nmany with a 9th-level slot.\nConjure Celestial\n7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou summon a celestial of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears\nin an unoccupied space that you can see within range.

Contacting this\nextraplanar intelligence can strain or even break your mind. When\nyou cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence saving throw. On a\nfailure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until you finish\na long rest.

The GM answers\neach question with one word, such as yes, no,\nmaybe, never, irrelevant, or unclear (if\nthe entity doesn’t know the answer to the question).

Make a melee spell attack against a\ncreature within your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with\na disease of your choice from any of the ones described below.\nAt the end of each of the target’s turns, it must make a\nConstitution saving throw. After failing three of these saving\nthrows, the disease’s effects last for the duration, and the\ncreature stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of\nthese saving throws, the creature recovers from the disease, and the\nspell ends.\nSince this spell induces a natural disease in its target, any effect\nthat removes a disease or otherwise ameliorates a disease’s effects\napply to it.\nBlinding Sickness. Pain grips the creature’s mind, and its\neyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage on Wisdom checks\nand Wisdom saving throws and is blinded.\nFilth Fever.

In addition,\nwhenever the creature takes damage, it is stunned until the end of its\nnext turn.\nContingency\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a statuette of yourself carved from ivory and decorated with gems worth at least 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 10 days\nChoose a spell of 5th level or lower that you can cast, that has a\ncasting time of 1 action, and that can target you. You cast that\nspell—called the contingent spell—as part of casting\ncontingency, expending spell slots for\nboth, but the contingent spell doesn’t come into effect. Instead, it\ntakes effect when a certain circumstance occurs. You describe that\ncircumstance when you cast the two spells. For example, a\ncontingency cast with\nwater breathing\nmight stipulate that\nwater breathing comes\ninto effect when you are engulfed in water or a similar liquid.\nThe contingent spell takes effect immediately after the circumstance\nis met for the first time, whether or not you want it to, and then\ncontingency ends.\nThe contingent spell takes effect only on you, even if it can\nnormally target others. You can use only one\ncontingency spell at a time. If you cast\nthis spell again, the effect of another\ncontingency spell on you ends. Also,\ncontingency ends on you if its material\ncomponent is ever not on your person.\nContinual Flame\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nA flame, equivalent in brightness to a torch, springs forth from an\nobject that you touch. The effect looks like a regular flame, but it\ncreates no heat and doesn’t use oxygen. A\ncontinual flame can be covered or hidden\nbut not smothered or quenched.\nControl Water\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of water and a pinch of dust)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nUntil the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an\narea you choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can\nchoose from any of the following effects when you cast this spell.\nAs an action on your turn, you can repeat the same effect or choose\na different one.\nFlood. You cause the water level of all standing water in the\narea to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the area includes a shore,\nthe flooding water spills over onto dry land.\nIf you choose an area in a large body of water, you instead create a\n20-foot tall wave that travels from one side of the area to the\nother and then crashes down. Any Huge or smaller vehicles in the\nwave’s path are carried with it to the other side. Any Huge or\nsmaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance of\ncapsizing.\nThe water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose\na different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats\non the start of your next turn while the flood effect lasts.\nPart Water. You cause water in the area to move apart and\ncreate a trench. The trench extends across the spell’s area, and the\nseparated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains\nuntil the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water\nthen slowly fills in the trench over the course of the next round\nuntil the normal water level is restored.\nRedirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move in\na direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over\nobstacles, up walls, or in other unlikely directions. The water in\nthe area moves as you direct it, but once it moves beyond the\nspell’s area, it resumes its flow based on the terrain conditions.\nThe water continues to move in the direction you chose until the\nspell ends or you choose a different effect.\nWhirlpool. This effect requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall. Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled 10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength (Athletics) check against your spell save DC.  When a creature enters the vortex for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature takes half damage, and isn’t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so.\nThe first time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the\nobject takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage; this damage occurs each round\nit remains in the vortex.\nControl Weather\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self (5-mile radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense and bits of earth and wood mixed in water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\nYou take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the\nduration. You must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place\nwhere you don’t have a clear path to the sky ends the spell early.\nWhen you cast the spell, you change the current weather conditions,\nwhich are determined by the GM based on the climate and season. You\ncan change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4\n× 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they\ndo so, you can change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the\nweather gradually returns to normal.\nWhen you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on\nthe following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When\nchanging the wind, you can change its direction.\nPrecipitation\nStage\nCondition\n1\nClear\n2\nLight clouds\n3\nOvercast or ground fog\n4\nRain, hail, or snow\n5\nTorrential rain, driving hail, or blizzard\nTemperature\nStage\nCondition\n1\nUnbearable heat\n2\nHot\n3\nWarm\n4\nCool\n5\nCold\n6\nArctic cold\nWind\nStage\nCondition\n1\nCalm\n2\nModerate wind\n3\nStrong wind\n4\nGale\n5\nStorm\nCreate Food and Water\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create 45 pounds of food and 30 gallons of water on the ground\nor in containers within range, enough to sustain up to fifteen\nhumanoids or five steeds for 24 hours.

You create up to 10 gallons of clean water\nwithin range in an open container. Alternatively, the water falls as\nrain in a 30-foot cube within range, extinguishing exposed flames in\nthe area.\nDestroy Water. You destroy up to 10 gallons of water in an\nopen container within range. Alternatively, you destroy fog in a\n30-foot cube within range.\nAt Higher Levels.

Choose up to three corpses of\nMedium or Small humanoids within range. Each corpse becomes a ghoul\nunder your control. (The GM has game statistics for these\ncreatures.)\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns, you can mentally command\nany creature you animated with this spell if the creature is within\n120 feet of you (if you control multiple creatures, you can command\nany or all of them at the same time, issuing the same command to\neach one). You decide what action the creature will take and where\nit will move during its next turn, or you can issue a general\ncommand, such as to guard a particular chamber or corridor. If you\nissue no commands, the creature only defends itself against hostile\ncreatures. Once given an order, the creature continues to follow it\nuntil its task is complete.\nThe creature is under your control for 24 hours, after which it\nstops obeying any command you have given it. To maintain control of\nthe creature for another 24 hours, you must cast this spell on the\ncreature before the current 24-hour period ends. This use of the\nspell reasserts your control over up to three creatures you have\nanimated with this spell, rather than animating new ones.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level\nspell slot, you can animate or reassert control over four ghouls.\nWhen you cast this spell using an 8th-level spell slot, you can\nanimate or reassert control over five ghouls or two ghasts or\nwights.

You can also use this spell to create\nmineral objects such as stone, crystal, or metal. The object created\nmust be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and the object must be of a\nform and material that you have seen before.\nThe duration depends on the object’s material. If the object is\ncomposed of multiple materials, use the shortest duration.\nMaterial\nDuration\nVegetable matter\n1 day\nStone or crystal\n12 hours\nPrecious metals\n1 hour\nGems\n10 minutes\nAdamantine or mithral\n1 minute\nUsing any material created by this spell as another spell’s material\ncomponent causes that spell to fail.\nAt Higher Levels.

You can also combine the four lights into one\nglowing vaguely humanoid form of Medium size. Whichever form you\nchoose, each light sheds dim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the lights up to 60\nfeet to a new spot within range. A light must be within 20 feet of\nanother light created by this spell, and a light winks out if it\nexceeds the spell’s range.\nDarkness\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (bat fur and a drop of pitch or piece of coal)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nMagical darkness spreads from a point you choose within range to\nfill a 15-foot-radius sphere for the duration. The darkness spreads\naround corners. A creature with darkvision can’t see through this\ndarkness, and nonmagical light can’t illuminate it.\nIf the point you choose is on an object you are holding or one that\nisn’t being worn or carried, the darkness emanates from the object\nand moves with it. Completely covering the source of the darkness\nwith an opaque object, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the\ndarkness.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of light created\nby a spell of 2nd level or lower, the spell that created the light\nis dispelled.\nDarkvision\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (either a pinch of dried carrot or an agate)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a willing creature to grant it the ability to see in the\ndark. For the duration, that creature has darkvision out to a range\nof 60 feet.\nDaylight\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nA 60-foot-radius sphere of light spreads out from a point you choose\nwithin range. The sphere is bright light and sheds dim light for an\nadditional 60 feet.\nIf you chose a point on an object you are holding or one that isn’t\nbeing worn or carried, the light shines from the object and moves\nwith it. Completely covering the affected object with an opaque\nobject, such as a bowl or a helm, blocks the light.\nIf any of this spell’s area overlaps with an area of darkness\ncreated by a spell of 3rd level or lower, the spell that created the\ndarkness is dispelled.\nDeath Ward\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a creature and grant it a measure of protection from\ndeath.\nThe first time the target would drop to 0 hit points as a result of\ntaking damage, the target instead drops to 1 hit point, and the\nspell ends.\nIf the spell is still in effect when the target is subjected to an\neffect that would kill it instantaneously without dealing damage,\nthat effect is instead negated against the target, and the spell\nends.\nDelayed Blast Fireball\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA beam of yellow light flashes from your pointing finger, then\ncondenses to linger at a chosen point within range as a glowing bead\nfor the duration. When the spell ends, either because your\nconcentration is broken or because you decide to end it, the bead\nblossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame that spreads\naround corners. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on\nthat point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes fire\ndamage equal to the total accumulated damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one.\nThe spell’s base damage is 12d6. If at the end of your turn the bead\nhas not yet detonated, the damage increases by 1d6.\nIf the glowing bead is touched before the interval has expired, the\ncreature touching it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed\nsave, the spell ends immediately, causing the bead to erupt in\nflame. On a successful save, the creature can throw the bead up to\n40 feet. When it strikes a creature or a solid object, the spell\nends, and the bead explodes.\nThe fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects\nthat aren’t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 8th level or higher, the base damage increases by 1d6 for each\nslot level above 7th.\nDemiplane\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou create a shadowy door on a flat solid surface that you can see\nwithin range. The door is large enough to allow Medium creatures to\npass through unhindered. When opened, the door leads to a demiplane that appears to be an\nempty room 30 feet in each dimension, made of wood or stone. When\nthe spell ends, the door disappears, and any creatures or objects\ninside the demiplane remain trapped there, as the door also\ndisappears from the other side.\nEach time you cast this spell, you can create a new demiplane, or\nhave the shadowy door connect to a demiplane you created with a\nprevious casting of this spell. Additionally, if you know the nature\nand contents of a demiplane created by a casting of this spell by\nanother creature, you can have the shadowy door connect to its\ndemiplane instead.\nDetect Evil and Good\n1st-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you know if there is an aberration, celestial,\nelemental, fey, fiend, or undead within 30 feet of you, as well as\nwhere the creature is located. Similarly, you know if there is a\nplace or object within 30 feet of you that has been magically\nconsecrated or desecrated.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot\nof stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of\nwood or dirt.\nDetect Magic\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of\nyou. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see\na faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that\nbears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot\nof stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of\nwood or dirt.\nDetect Poison and Disease\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a yew leaf)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, you can sense the presence and location of\npoisons, poisonous creatures, and diseases within 30 feet of you.\nYou also identify the kind of poison, poisonous creature, or disease\nin each case.\nThe spell can penetrate most barriers, but it is blocked by 1 foot\nof stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of\nwood or dirt.\nDetect Thoughts\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a copper piece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nFor the duration, you can read the thoughts of certain creatures.\nWhen you cast the spell and as your action on each turn until the\nspell ends, you can focus your mind on any one creature that you can\nsee within 30 feet of you. If the creature you choose has an\nIntelligence of 3 or lower or doesn’t speak any language, the\ncreature is unaffected.\nYou initially learn the surface thoughts of the creature—what\nis most on its mind in that moment. As an action, you can either\nshift your attention to another creature’s thoughts or attempt to\nprobe deeper into the same creature’s mind. If you probe deeper, the\ntarget must make a Wisdom saving throw. If it fails, you gain\ninsight into its reasoning (if any), its emotional state, and\nsomething that looms large in its mind (such as something it worries\nover, loves, or hates). If it succeeds, the spell ends. Either way,\nthe target knows that you are probing into its mind, and unless you\nshift your attention to another creature’s thoughts, the creature\ncan use its action on its turn to make an Intelligence check\ncontested by your Intelligence check; if it succeeds, the spell\nends.\nQuestions verbally directed at the target creature naturally shape\nthe course of its thoughts, so this spell is particularly effective\nas part of an interrogation.\nYou can also use this spell to detect the presence of thinking\ncreatures you can’t see. When you cast the spell or as your action\nduring the duration, you can search for thoughts within 30 feet of\nyou. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 2 feet of rock, 2 inches\nof any metal other than lead, or a thin sheet of lead blocks you.\nYou can’t detect a creature with an Intelligence of 3 or lower or\none that doesn’t speak any language.\nOnce you detect the presence of a creature in this way, you can read\nits thoughts for the rest of the duration as described above, even\nif you can’t see it, but it must still be within range.\nDimension Door\n4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot\nwithin range. You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a\nplace you can see, one you can visualize, or one you can describe by\nstating distance and direction, such as 200 feet straight\ndownward or upward to the northwest at a 45-degree angle, 300\nfeet.\nYou can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn’t exceed\nwhat you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your\nsize or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity.\nThe creature must be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell.\nIf you would arrive in a place already occupied by an object or a\ncreature, you and any creature traveling with you each take 4d6\nforce damage, and the spell fails to teleport you.\nDisguise Self\n1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and\nother belongings on your person—look different until the spell\nends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot\nshorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t\nchange your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same\nbasic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is\nup to you.\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical\ninspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your\noutfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it\nwould feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this\nspell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who\nreaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly\nstill in midair.\nTo discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to\ninspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence\n(Investigation) check against your spell save DC.\nDisintegrate\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that\nyou can see within range. The target can be a creature, an object,\nor a creation of magical force, such as the wall created by wall of force.\nA creature targeted by this spell must make a Dexterity saving\nthrow. On a failed save, the target takes 10d6 + 40 force damage. If\nthis damage reduces the target to 0 hit points, it is disintegrated.\nA disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and carrying,\nexcept magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The\ncreature can be restored to life only by means of a\ntrue resurrection or\na wish spell.\nThis spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical\nobject or a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or\nlarger object or creation of force, this spell disintegrates a\n10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item is unaffected by this\nspell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot\nlevel above 6th.\nDispel Evil and Good\n5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nShimmering energy surrounds and protects you from fey, undead, and creatures originating from beyond the Material Plane. For the duration, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead have disadvantage on attack rolls against you.\nYou can end the spell early by using either of the following special\nfunctions.\nBreak Enchantment. As your action, you touch a creature you\ncan reach that is charmed, frightened, or possessed by\na celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead. The\ncreature you touch is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed by\nsuch creatures.\nDismissal. As your action, make a melee spell attack against\na celestial, an elemental, a fey, a fiend, or an undead you can\nreach. On a hit, you attempt to drive the creature back to its home\nplane. The creature must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be\nsent back to its home plane (if it isn’t there already). If they\naren’t on their home plane, undead are sent to the Shadowfell, and\nfey are sent to the Feywild.\nDispel Magic\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nChoose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any\nspell of 3rd level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of\n4th level or higher on the target, make an ability check using your\nspellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a\nsuccessful check, the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell\non the target if the spell’s level is equal to or less than the\nlevel of the spell slot you used.\nDivination\n4th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and a sacrificial offering appropriate to your religion, together worth at least 25 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYour magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god’s\nservants. You ask a single question concerning a specific goal,\nevent, or activity to occur within 7 days. The GM offers a truthful\nreply. The reply might be a short phrase, a cryptic rhyme, or an\nomen.\nThe spell doesn’t take into account any possible circumstances that\nmight change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells\nor the loss or gain of a companion.\nIf you cast the spell two or more times before finishing your next\nlong rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting\nafter the first that you get a random reading. The GM makes this\nroll in secret.\nDivine Favor\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYour prayer empowers you with divine radiance. Until the spell ends,\nyour weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 radiant damage on a hit.\nDivine Word\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world\nat the dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see\nwithin range. Each creature that can hear you must make a Charisma\nsaving throw. On a failed save, a creature suffers an effect based\non its current hit points:\n50 hit points or fewer: deafened for 1 minute\n40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded for 10 minutes\n30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned for 1 hour\n20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly\nRegardless of its current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a\nfey, or a fiend that fails its save is forced back to its plane of\norigin (if it isn’t there already) and can’t return to your current\nplane for 24 hours by any means short of a wish spell.\nDominate Beast\n4th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It\nmust succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the\nduration. If you or creatures that are friendly to you are fighting\nit, it has advantage on the\nsaving throw.\nWhile the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as\nlong as the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can\nuse this telepathic link to issue commands to the creature while you\nare conscious (no action required), which it does its best to obey.\nYou can specify a simple and general course of action, such as\nAttack that creature, Run over there, or Fetch that\nobject. If the creature completes the order and doesn’t receive\nfurther direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the\nbest of its ability.\nYou can use your action to take total and precise control of the\ntarget. Until the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the\nactions you choose, and doesn’t do anything that you don’t allow it\nto do. During this time, you can also cause the creature to use a\nreaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction as well.\nEach time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving\nthrow against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell\nends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 5th-level\nspell slot, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When\nyou use a 6th-level spell slot, the duration is concentration, up to\n1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the\nduration is concentration, up to 8 hours.\nDominate Monster\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It\nmust succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the\nduration.

Choose a creature known to\nyou as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same\nplane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as\nelves, can’t be contacted by this spell.

The messenger can also\nshape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects,\nand other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any\ntime, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the\ndream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast\nthe spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance\n(and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which\npoint the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.\nYou can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the\ntarget. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more\nthan ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw.\nOn a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a\nnightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents\nthe target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition,\nwhen the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.\nIf you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or\nsimilar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving\nthrow with disadvantage."

    "text": "Spells: E\nSpells: E\nEarthquake\n8th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of dirt, a piece of rock, and a lump of clay)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you\ncan see within range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips\nthrough the ground in a 100-foot-radius circle centered on that\npoint and shakes creatures and structures in contact with the ground\nin that area.\nThe ground in the area becomes difficult terrain. Each\ncreature on the ground that is concentrating must make a\nConstitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature’s\nconcentration is broken.\nWhen you cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend\nconcentrating on it, each creature on the ground in the area must\nmake a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is\nknocked prone.\nThis spell can have additional effects depending on the terrain in\nthe area, as determined by the GM.\nFissures. Fissures open throughout the spell’s area at the\nstart of your next turn after you cast the spell. A total of 1d6\nsuch fissures open in locations chosen by the GM. Each is 1d10\n× 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the\nspell’s area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot\nwhere a fissure opens must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or\nfall in. A creature that successfully saves moves with the fissure’s\nedge as it opens.\nA fissure that opens beneath a structure causes it to automatically\ncollapse (see below).\nStructures. The tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until the spell ends.  If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure’s height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The GM can adjust the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn’t fall prone or become buried.\nEnhance Ability\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (fur or a feather from a beast)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour.\nYou touch a creature and bestow upon it a magical enhancement.\nChoose one of the following effects; the target gains that effect\nuntil the spell ends.\nBear’s Endurance. The target has advantage on Constitution\nchecks. It also gains 2d6 temporary hit points, which are lost when\nthe spell ends.\nBull’s Strength. The target has advantage on Strength checks,\nand his or her carrying capacity doubles.\nCat’s Grace. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks.\nIt also doesn’t take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn’t\nincapacitated.\nEagle’s Splendor. The target has advantage on Charisma checks.\nFox’s Cunning. The target has advantage on Intelligence\nchecks.\nOwl’s Wisdom. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, you can target one additional creature for\neach slot level above 2nd.\nEnlarge/Reduce\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow\nlarger or smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an\nobject that is neither worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling,\nit can make a Constitution saving throw. On a success, the spell has\nno effect.\nIf the target is a creature, everything it is wearing and carrying\nchanges size with it. Any item dropped by an affected creature\nreturns to normal size at once.\nEnlarge. The target’s size doubles in all dimensions, and its\nweight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases its size by one\ncategory—from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn’t\nenough room for the target to double its size, the creature or\nobject attains the maximum possible size in the space available.\nUntil the spell ends, the target also has advantage on Strength checks\nand Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also grow to match\nits new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the target’s attacks\nwith them deal 1d4 extra damage.\nReduce. The target’s size is halved in all dimensions, and\nits weight is reduced to one-eighth of normal. This reduction\ndecreases its size by one category—from Medium to Small, for\nexample. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on Strength\nchecks and Strength saving throws. The target’s weapons also shrink\nto match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target’s\nattacks with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can’t reduce the damage\nbelow 1).\nEntangle\n1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nGrasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square\nstarting from a point within range. For the duration, these plants\nturn the ground in the area into difficult terrain.\nA creature in the area when you cast the spell must succeed on a\nStrength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling\nplants until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can\nuse its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC.\nOn a success, it frees itself.\nWhen the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.\nEnthrall\n2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your\nchoice that you can see within range and that can hear you to make a\nWisdom saving throw. Any creature that can’t be charmed succeeds on\nthis saving throw automatically, and if you or your companions are\nfighting a creature, it has advantage on the save. On a\nfailed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom\n(Perception) checks made to perceive any creature other than you\nuntil the spell ends or until the target can no longer hear you. The\nspell ends if you are incapacitated or can no\nlonger speak.\nEtherealness\n7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 8 hours\nYou step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area\nwhere it overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border\nEthereal for the duration or until you use your action to dismiss\nthe spell. During this time, you can move in any direction. If you\nmove up or down, every foot of movement costs an extra foot. You can\nsee and hear the plane you originated from, but everything there\nlooks gray, and you can’t see anything more than 60 feet away.\nWhile on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by\nother creatures on that plane. Creatures that aren’t on the Ethereal\nPlane can’t perceive you and can’t interact with you, unless a\nspecial ability or magic has given them the ability to do so.\nYou ignore all objects and effects that aren’t on the Ethereal\nPlane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the\nplane you originated from.\nWhen the spell ends, you immediately return to the plane you\noriginated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the\nsame spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are\nimmediately shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can\noccupy and take force damage equal to twice the number of feet you\nare moved.\nThis spell has no effect if you cast it while you are on the\nEthereal Plane or a plane that doesn’t border it, such as one of the\nOuter Planes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 8th level or higher, you can target up to three willing creatures\n(including you) for each slot level above 7th. The creatures must be\nwithin 10 feet of you when you cast the spell.\nExpeditious Retreat\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nThis spell allows you to move at an incredible pace. When you cast\nthis spell, and then as a bonus action on each of your turns until\nthe spell ends, you can take the Dash action.\nEyebite\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nFor the spell’s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to target another creature but can’t target a creature again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.\nAsleep. The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake.\nPanicked. The target is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route, unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends.\nSickened. The target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect ends."

    "text": "Spells: F\nSpells: F\nFabricate\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou convert raw materials into products of the same material. For\nexample, you can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a\nrope from a patch of hemp, and clothes from flax or wool.\nChoose raw materials that you can see within range. You can\nfabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot\ncube, or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity\nof raw material. If you are working with metal, stone, or another\nmineral substance, however, the fabricated object can be no larger\nthan Medium (contained within a single 5-foot cube). The quality of\nobjects made by the spell is commensurate with the quality of the\nraw materials.\nCreatures or magic items can’t be created or transmuted by this\nspell. You also can’t use it to create items that ordinarily require\na high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons, glass, or\narmor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan’s tools\nused to craft such objects.\nFaerie Fire\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nEach object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue,\ngreen, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when\nthe spell is cast is also outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity\nsaving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed\ndim light in a 10-foot radius.\nAny attack roll against an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can\nsee it, and the affected creature or object can’t benefit from being\ninvisible.\nFaithful Hound\n4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny silver whistle, a piece of bone, and a thread)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can\nsee within range, where it remains for the duration, until you\ndismiss it as an action, or until you move more than 100 feet away\nfrom it.\nThe hound is invisible to\nall creatures except you and can’t be harmed. When a Small or larger\ncreature comes within 30 feet of it without first speaking the\npassword that you specify when you cast this spell, the hound starts\nbarking loudly. The hound sees invisible creatures and can\nsee into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.\nAt the start of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one\ncreature within 5 feet of it that is hostile to you. The hound’s\nattack bonus is equal to your spellcasting ability modifier + your\nproficiency bonus. On a hit, it deals 4d8 piercing damage.\nFalse Life\n1st-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)\nDuration: 1 hour\nBolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain\n1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points\nfor each slot level above 1st.\nFear\n3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (30-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S, M (a white feather or the heart of a hen)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou project a phantasmal image of a creature’s worst fears. Each creature in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is holding and become frightened for the duration.\nWhile frightened by this spell, a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature ends its turn in a location where it doesn’t have line of sight to you, the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.\nFeather Fall\n1st-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you or a creature within 60 feet of you falls\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a small feather or piece of down)\nDuration: 1 minute\nChoose up to five falling creatures within range. A falling\ncreature’s rate of descent slows to 60 feet per round until the\nspell ends. If the creature lands before the spell ends, it takes no\nfalling damage and can land on its feet, and the spell ends for that\ncreature.\nFeeblemind\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, glass, or mineral spheres)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range,\nattempting to shatter its intellect and personality. The target\ntakes 4d6 psychic damage and must make an Intelligence saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the creature’s Intelligence and Charisma scores\nbecome 1. The creature can’t cast spells, activate magic items,\nunderstand language, or communicate in any intelligible way. The\ncreature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even\nprotect them.\nAt the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving\nthrow against this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the\nspell ends.\nThe spell can also be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish.\nFind Steed\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually\nintelligent, strong, and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond\nwith it. Appearing in an unoccupied space within range, the steed\ntakes on a form that you choose: a warhorse, a pony, a camel, an\nelk, or a mastiff. (Your GM might allow other animals to be summoned\nas steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though\nit is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal\ntype. Additionally, if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less,\nits Intelligence becomes 6, and it gains the ability to understand\none language of your choice that you speak.\nYour steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you\nhave an instinctive bond with it that allows you to fight as a\nseamless unit. While mounted on your steed, you can make any spell\nyou cast that targets only you also target your steed.\nWhen the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind\nno physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an\naction, causing it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell\nagain summons the same steed, restored to its hit point maximum.\nWhile your steed is within 1 mile of you, you can communicate with\nit telepathically.\nYou can’t have more than one steed bonded by this spell at a time.\nAs an action, you can release the steed from its bond at any time,\ncausing it to disappear.\nFind the Path\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a set of divinatory tools—such as bones, ivory sticks, cards, teeth, or carved runes—worth 100 gp and an object from the location you wish to find)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 day\nThis spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical\nroute to a specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the\nsame plane of existence. If you name a destination on another plane\nof existence, a destination that moves (such as a mobile fortress),\nor a destination that isn’t specific (such as a green dragon’s\nlair), the spell fails.\nFor the duration, as long as you are on the same plane of existence\nas the destination, you know how far it is and in what direction it\nlies. While you are traveling there, whenever you are presented with\na choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine which\npath is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the\nsafest route) to the destination.\nFind Traps\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line\nof sight. A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything\nthat would inflict a sudden or unexpected effect you consider\nharmful or undesirable, which was specifically intended as such by\nits creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a\nmechanical pit trap, but it would not reveal a natural weakness in\nthe floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden sinkhole.\nThis spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don’t learn\nthe location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of\nthe danger posed by a trap you sense.\nFinger of Death\n7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can\nsee within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a\nConstitution saving throw. It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a\nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nA humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn\nas a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your\nverbal orders to the best of its ability.\nFireball\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny ball of bat guano and sulfur)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you\nchoose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into an\nexplosion of flame. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius sphere\ncentered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target\ntakes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a\nsuccessful one.\nThe fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects in the\narea that aren’t being worn or carried.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot\nlevel above 3rd.\nFire Shield\n4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of phosphorus or a firefly)\nDuration: 10 minutes\nThin and wispy flames wreathe your body for the duration, shedding\nbright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10\nfeet. You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it.\nThe flames provide you with a warm shield or a chill shield, as you\nchoose. The warm shield grants you resistance to cold damage, and\nthe chill shield grants you resistance to fire damage.\nIn addition, whenever a creature within 5 feet of you hits you with\na melee attack, the shield erupts with flame. The attacker takes 2d8\nfire damage from a warm shield, or 2d8 cold damage from a cold\nshield.\nFire Storm\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA storm made up of sheets of roaring flame appears in a location you\nchoose within range. The area of the storm consists of up to ten\n10-foot cubes, which you can arrange as you wish. Each cube must\nhave at least one face adjacent to the face of another cube. Each\ncreature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes\n7d10 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a\nsuccessful one.\nThe fire damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects\nthat aren’t being worn or carried. If you choose, plant life in the\narea is unaffected by this spell.\nFlame Blade\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (leaf of sumac)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in\nsize and shape to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you\nlet go of the blade, it disappears, but you can evoke the blade\nagain as a bonus action.\nYou can use your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery\nblade. On a hit, the target takes 3d6 fire damage.\nThe flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim\nlight for an additional 10 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two\nslot levels above 2nd.\nFlame Strike\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (pinch of sulfur)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a\nlocation you specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius,\n40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range must make a\nDexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6 fire damage and 4d6\nradiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a\nsuccessful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your\nchoice) increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 5th.\nFlaming Sphere\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of tallow, a pinch of brimstone, and a dusting of powdered iron)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of\nyour choice within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature\nthat ends its turn within 5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity\nsaving throw. The creature takes 2d6 fire damage on a failed save,\nor half as much damage on a successful one.\nAs a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram\nthe sphere into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw\nagainst the sphere’s damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn.\nWhen you move the sphere, you can direct it over barriers up to 5\nfeet tall and jump it across pits up to 10 feet wide. The sphere\nignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and it sheds\nbright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20\nfeet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot\nlevel above 2nd.\nFlesh to Stone\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of lime, water, and earth)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into\nstone. If the target’s body is made of flesh, the creature must make\na Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh\nbegins to harden. On a successful save, the creature isn’t affected.\nA creature restrained by this spell must make another Constitution\nsaving throw at the end of each of its turns. If it successfully\nsaves against this spell three times, the spell ends. If it fails\nits saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected to the\npetrified condition for the\nduration. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive;\nkeep track of both until the target collects three of a kind.\nIf the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers\nfrom similar deformities if it reverts to its original state.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for the entire\npossible duration, the creature is turned to stone until the effect\nis removed.\nFloating Disk\n1st-level conjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell creates a circular, horizontal plane of force, 3 feet in\ndiameter and 1 inch thick, that floats 3 feet above the ground in an\nunoccupied space of your choice that you can see within range. The\ndisk remains for the duration, and can hold up to 500 pounds. If\nmore weight is placed on it, the spell ends, and everything on the\ndisk falls to the ground.\nThe disk is immobile while you are within 20 feet of it. If you move\nmore than 20 feet away from it, the disk follows you so that it\nremains within 20 feet of you. It can move across uneven terrain, up\nor down stairs, slopes and the like, but it can’t cross an elevation\nchange of 10 feet or more. For example, the disk can’t move across a\n10-foot-deep pit, nor could it leave such a pit if it was created at\nthe bottom.\nIf you move more than 100 feet from the disk (typically because it\ncan’t move around an obstacle to follow you), the spell ends.\nFly\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a wing feather from any bird)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou touch a willing creature.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, you can target one additional creature for\neach slot level above 3rd.\nFog Cloud\n1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within\nrange. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily\nobscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or\ngreater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet\nfor each slot level above 1st.\nForbiddance\n6th-level abjuration (ritual)\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkling of holy water, rare incense, and powdered ruby worth at least 1,000 gp)\nDuration: 1 day\nYou create a ward against magical travel that protects up to 40,000\nsquare feet of floor space to a height of 30 feet above the floor.\nFor the duration, creatures can’t teleport into the area or use\nportals, such as those created by the gate\nspell, to enter the area. The spell proofs the area against planar\ntravel, and therefore prevents creatures from accessing the area by\nway of the Astral Plane, Ethereal Plane, Feywild, Shadowfell, or the\nplane shift spell.\nIn addition, the spell damages types of creatures that you choose\nwhen you cast it. Choose one or more of the following: celestials,\nelementals, fey, fiends, and undead. When a chosen creature enters\nthe spell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn\nthere, the creature takes 5d10 radiant or necrotic damage (your\nchoice when you cast this spell).\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate a password. A creature\nthat speaks the password as it enters the area takes no damage from\nthe spell.\nThe spell’s area can’t overlap with the area of another\nforbiddance spell. If you cast\nforbiddance every day for 30 days in the same\nlocation, the spell lasts until it is dispelled, and the material\ncomponents are consumed on the last casting.\nForcecage\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (ruby dust worth 1,500 gp)\nDuration: 1 hour\nAn immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force\nsprings into existence around an area you choose within range. The\nprison can be a cage or a solid box, as you choose.\nA prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20 feet on a side and\nis made from ½-inch diameter bars spaced ½ inch apart.\nA prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side,\ncreating a solid barrier that prevents any matter from passing\nthrough it and blocking any spells cast into or out from the area.\nWhen you cast the spell, any creature that is completely inside the\ncage’s area is trapped. Creatures only partially within the area, or\nthose too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the\ncenter of the area until they are completely outside the area.\nA creature inside the cage can’t leave it by nonmagical means. If\nthe creature tries to use teleportation or interplanar travel to\nleave the cage, it must first make a Charisma saving throw. On a\nsuccess, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage. On a\nfailure, the creature can’t exit the cage and wastes the use of the\nspell or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane,\nblocking ethereal travel.\nThis spell can’t be dispelled by dispel magic.\nForesight\n9th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a hummingbird feather)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou touch a willing creature and bestow a limited ability to see\ninto the immediate future. For the duration, the target can’t be\nsurprised and has advantage\non attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws. Additionally,\nother creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls\nagainst the target for the duration.\nThis spell immediately ends if you cast it again before its duration\nends.\nFreedom of Movement\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a leather strap, bound around the arm or a similar appendage)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target’s\nmovement is unaffected by difficult terrain, and\nspells and other magical effects can neither reduce the target’s\nspeed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.\nThe target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape\nfrom nonmagical restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has\nit grappled. Finally, being\nunderwater imposes no penalties on the target’s movement or attacks.\nFreezing Sphere\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 300 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal sphere)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a\npoint of your choice within range, where it explodes in a\n60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature within the area must make a\nConstitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d6\ncold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.\nIf the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally\nwater (not including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid\nto a depth of 6 inches over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts\nfor 1 minute. Creatures that were swimming on the surface of frozen\nwater are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature can use an action\nto make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break free.\nYou can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if\nyou wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the\ntouch, appears in your hand. At any time, you or a creature you give\nthe globe to can throw the globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it\nwith a sling (to the sling’s normal range). It shatters on impact,\nwith the same effect as the normal casting of the spell. You can\nalso set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute, if\nthe globe hasn’t already shattered, it explodes.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot\nlevel above 6th."

The\nspell ends if the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal\ncreature isn’t affected.\nWhile in this form, the target’s only method of movement is a flying\nspeed of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of\nanother creature. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage,\nand it has advantage on\nStrength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can\npass through small holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks,\nthough it treats liquids as though they were solid surfaces. The\ntarget can’t fall and remains hovering in the air even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated.\nWhile in the form of a misty cloud, the target can’t talk or\nmanipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying or holding can’t\nbe dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target can’t\nattack or cast spells.\nGate\n9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 5,000 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within\nrange to a precise location on a different plane of existence. The\nportal is a circular opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in\ndiameter. You can orient the portal in any direction you choose. The\nportal lasts for the duration.\nThe portal has a front and a back on each plane where it appears.\nTravel through the portal is possible only by moving through its\nfront. Anything that does so is instantly transported to the other\nplane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to the portal.\nDeities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this\nspell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their\ndomains.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific\ncreature (a pseudonym, title, or nickname doesn’t work). If that\ncreature is on a plane other than the one you are on, the portal\nopens in the named creature’s immediate vicinity and draws the\ncreature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side of\nthe portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is\nfree to act as the GM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you,\nor help you.\nGeas\n5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: 30 days\nYou place a magical command on a creature that you can see within\nrange, forcing it to carry out some service or refrain from some\naction or course of activity as you decide. If the creature can\nunderstand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become\ncharmed by you for the\nduration. While the creature is charmed by you, it takes 5d10\npsychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to\nyour instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that\ncan’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.\nYou can issue any command you choose, short of an activity that\nwould result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal command,\nthe spell ends.\nYou can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A remove curse, greater restoration,\nor wish spell also ends it.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th or 8th level, the duration is 1 year. When you cast this\nspell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is\nended by one of the spells mentioned above.\nGentle Repose\n2nd-level necromancy (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of salt and one copper piece placed on each of the corpse’s eyes, which must remain there for the duration)\nDuration: 10 days\nYou touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is\nprotected from decay and can’t become undead.\nThe spell also effectively extends the time limit on raising the\ntarget from the dead, since days spent under the influence of this\nspell don’t count against the time limit of spells such as raise dead.\nGiant Insect\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or\none scorpion within range into giant versions of their natural forms\nfor the duration. A centipede becomes a giant centipede, a spider\nbecomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a giant wasp, and a scorpion\nbecomes a giant scorpion.\nEach creature obeys your verbal commands, and in combat, they act on\nyour turn each round. The GM has the statistics for these creatures\nand resolves their actions and movement.\nA creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it\ndrops to 0 hit points, or until you use an action to dismiss the\neffect on it.\nThe GM might allow you to choose different targets. For example, if\nyou transform a bee, its giant version might have the same\nstatistics as a giant wasp.\nGlibness\n8th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: 1 hour\nUntil the spell ends, when you make a Charisma check, you can\nreplace the number you roll with a 15. Additionally, no matter what\nyou say, magic that would determine if you are telling the truth\nindicates that you are being truthful.\nGlobe of Invulnerability\n6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (10-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (a glass or crystal bead that shatters when the spell ends)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nAn immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a\n10-foot radius around you and remains for the duration.\nAny spell of 5th level or lower cast from outside the barrier can’t\naffect creatures or objects within it, even if the spell is cast\nusing a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures\nand objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them.\nSimilarly, the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas\naffected by such spells.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th level or higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level\nhigher for each slot level above 6th.\nGlyph of Warding\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (incense and powdered diamond worth at least 200 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a glyph that harms other\ncreatures, either upon a surface (such as a table or a section of\nfloor or wall) or within an object that can be closed (such as a\nbook, a scroll, or a treasure chest) to conceal the glyph. If you\nchoose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no\nlarger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that\nobject must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10\nfeet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the\nspell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible and requires a successful Intelligence\n(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to be found.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For\nglyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include\ntouching or standing on the glyph, removing another object covering\nthe glyph, approaching within a certain distance of the glyph, or\nmanipulating the object on which the glyph is inscribed. For glyphs\ninscribed within an object, the most common triggers include opening\nthat object, approaching within a certain distance of the object, or\nseeing or reading the glyph. Once a glyph is triggered, this spell\nends.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell activates only under\ncertain circumstances or according to physical characteristics (such\nas height or weight), creature kind (for example, the ward could be\nset to affect aberrations or drow), or alignment. You can also set\nconditions for creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as those\nwho say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose explosive runes or a\nspell glyph.\nExplosive Runes. When triggered, the glyph erupts with\nmagical energy in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on the glyph. The\nsphere spreads around corners. Each creature in the area must make a\nDexterity saving throw. A creature takes 5d8 acid, cold, fire,\nlightning, or thunder damage on a failed saving throw (your choice\nwhen you create the glyph), or half as much damage on a successful\none.\nSpell Glyph. You can store a prepared spell of 3rd level or\nlower in the glyph by casting it as part of creating the glyph. The\nspell must target a single creature or an area. The spell being\nstored has no immediate effect when cast in this way. When the glyph\nis triggered, the stored spell is cast. If the spell has a target,\nit targets the creature that triggered the glyph. If the spell\naffects an area, the area is centered on that creature. If the spell\nsummons hostile creatures or creates harmful objects or traps, they\nappear as close as possible to the intruder and attack it. If the\nspell requires concentration, it lasts until the end of its full\nduration.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, the damage of an explosive runes\nglyph increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd. If you create\na spell glyph, you can store any spell of up to the same\nlevel as the slot you use for the glyph of\nwarding.\nGrease\n1st-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of pork rind or butter)\nDuration: 1 minute\nSlick grease covers the ground in a 10-foot square centered on a\npoint within range and turns it into difficult terrain for the\nduration.\nWhen the grease appears, each creature standing in its area must\nsucceed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature that enters the\narea or ends its turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving\nthrow or fall prone.\nGreater Invisibility\n4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou or a creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell\nends. Anything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as\nlong as it is on the target’s person.\nGreater Restoration\n5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamond dust worth at least 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou imbue a creature you touch with positive energy to undo a\ndebilitating effect. You can reduce the target’s exhaustion level by one, or\nend one of the following effects on the target:\nOne effect that charmed or\npetrified the target\nOne curse, including the target’s attunement to a cursed magic\nitem\nAny reduction to one of the target’s ability scores\nOne effect reducing the target’s hit point maximum\nGuards and Wards\n6th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense, a small measure of brimstone and oil, a knotted string, a small amount of umber hulk blood, and a small silver rod worth at least 10 gp)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor\nspace (an area 50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or\ntwenty-five 10-foot squares). The warded area can be up to 20 feet\ntall, and shaped as you desire. You can ward several stories of a\nstronghold by dividing the area among them, as long as you can walk\ninto each contiguous area while you are casting the spell.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are\nunaffected by any or all of the effects that you choose. You can\nalso specify a password that, when spoken aloud, makes the speaker\nimmune to these effects.\nGuards and wards creates the following\neffects within the warded area.\nCorridors. Fog fills all the warded corridors, making them\nheavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or branching\npassage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance\nthat a creature other than you will believe it is going in the\nopposite direction from the one it chooses.\nDoors. All doors in the warded area are magically locked, as\nif sealed by an arcane lock\nspell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors with an illusion\n(equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion spell) to\nmake them appear as plain sections of wall.\nStairs. Webs fill all stairs in the warded area from top to\nbottom, as the web spell. These\nstrands regrow in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while\nguards and wards lasts.\nOther Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the\nfollowing magical effects within the warded area of the stronghold.\nPlace dancing lights\nin four corridors. You can designate a simple program that the\nlights repeat as long as guards and\nwards lasts.\nPlace magic mouth in two\nlocations.\nPlace stinking cloud\nin two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate;\nthey return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.\nPlace a constant gust of\nwind in one corridor or room.\nPlace a suggestion in one\nlocation. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any\ncreature that enters or passes through the area receives the\nsuggestion mentally.\nThe whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect, if\nsuccessful, removes only that effect.\nYou can create a permanently guarded and warded structure by casting\nthis spell there every day for one year.\nGuidance\nDivination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the\ntarget can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one ability check\nof its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the\nability check.

Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the\ntarget takes 4d6 radiant damage, and the next attack roll made\nagainst this target before the end of your next turn has advantage, thanks to the\nmystical dim light glittering on the target until then.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot\nlevel above 1st.\nGust of Wind\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a legume seed)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you\nin a direction you choose for the spell’s duration. Each creature\nthat starts its turn in the line must succeed on a Strength saving\nthrow or be pushed 15 feet away from you in a direction following\nthe line.\nAny creature in the line must spend 2 feet of movement for every 1\nfoot it moves when moving closer to you.\nThe gust disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles,\ntorches, and similar unprotected flames in the area. It causes\nprotected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has\na 50 percent chance to extinguish them.\nAs a bonus action on each of your turns before the spell ends, you\ncan change the direction in which the line blasts from you."

The affected area is subject to\nthe following effects.\nFirst, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead can’t enter\nthe area, nor can such creatures charm, frighten, or possess\ncreatures within it. Any creature charmed, frightened, or possessed\nby such a creature is no longer charmed, frightened, or possessed\nupon entering the area. You can exclude one or more of those types\nof creatures from this effect.\nSecond, you can bind an extra effect to the area. Choose the effect\nfrom the following list, or choose an effect offered by the GM. Some\nof these effects apply to creatures in the area; you can designate\nwhether the effect applies to all creatures, creatures that follow a\nspecific deity or leader, or creatures of a specific sort, such as\norcs or trolls. When a creature that would be affected enters the\nspell’s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,\nit can make a Charisma saving throw. On a success, the creature\nignores the extra effect until it leaves the area.\nCourage. Affected creatures can’t be frightened while in the\narea.\nDarkness. Darkness fills the area.

A pond can be made to seem\nlike a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a\nrock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured\nstructures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed\nin appearance.\nThe tactile characteristics of the terrain are unchanged, so\ncreatures entering the area are likely to see through the illusion.\nIf the difference isn’t obvious by touch, a creature carefully\nexamining the illusion can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation)\ncheck against your spell save DC to disbelieve it. A creature who\ndiscerns the illusion for what it is, sees it as a vague image\nsuperimposed on the terrain.\nHarm\n6th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within\nrange.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 5th level or higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for\neach slot level above 4th.\nIdentify\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pearl worth at least 100 gp and an owl feather)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of\nthe spell. If it is a magic item or some other magic-imbued object,\nyou learn its properties and how to use them, whether it requires\nattunement to use, and how many charges it has, if any. You learn\nwhether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the\nitem was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.\nIf you instead touch a creature throughout the casting, you learn\nwhat spells, if any, are currently affecting it.\nIllusory Script\n1st-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: S, M (a lead-based ink worth at least 10 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 10 days\nYou write on parchment, paper, or some other suitable writing\nmaterial and imbue it with a potent illusion that lasts for the\nduration.\nTo you and any creatures you designate when you cast the spell, the\nwriting appears normal, written in your hand, and conveys whatever\nmeaning you intended when you wrote the text. To all others, the\nwriting appears as if it were written in an unknown or magical\nscript that is unintelligible. Alternatively, you can cause the\nwriting to appear to be an entirely different message, written in a\ndifferent hand and language, though the language must be one you\nknow.\nShould the spell be dispelled, the original script and the illusion\nboth disappear.\nA creature with truesight can read the hidden message.\nImprisonment\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a vellum depiction or a carved statuette in the likeness of the target, and a special component that varies according to the version of the spell you choose, worth at least 500 gp per Hit Die of the target)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou create a magical restraint to hold a creature that you can see\nwithin range.

The target is entombed far beneath the earth in a\nsphere of magical force that is just large enough to contain the\ntarget. Nothing can pass through the sphere, nor can any creature\nteleport or use planar travel to get into or out of it.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a small\nmithral orb.\nChaining.

The target shrinks to a height of 1 inch\nand is imprisoned inside a gemstone or similar object. Light can\npass through the gemstone normally (allowing the target to see out\nand other creatures to see in), but nothing else can pass through,\neven by means of teleportation or planar travel. The gemstone can’t\nbe cut or broken while the spell remains in effect.\nThe special component for this version of the spell is a large,\ntransparent gemstone, such as a corundum, diamond, or ruby.\nSlumber. The target falls asleep and can’t be awoken. The\nspecial component for this version of the spell consists of rare\nsoporific herbs.\nEnding the Spell. During the casting of the spell, in any of\nits versions, you can specify a condition that will cause the spell\nto end and release the target. The condition can be as specific or\nas elaborate as you choose, but the GM must agree that the condition\nis reasonable and has a likelihood of coming to pass. The conditions\ncan be based on a creature’s name, identity, or deity but otherwise\nmust be based on observable actions or qualities and not based on\nintangibles such as level, class, or hit points.\nA dispel magic spell can\nend the spell only if it is cast as a 9th-level spell, targeting\neither the prison or the special component used to create it.\nYou can use a particular special component to create only one prison\nat a time. If you cast the spell again using the same component, the\ntarget of the first casting is immediately freed from its binding.\nIncendiary Cloud\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA swirling cloud of smoke shot through with white-hot embers appears\nin a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point within range.

The sphere’s area is difficult terrain.\nWhen the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution\nsaving throw.

Each time you cast this\nspell, you must use a different sapphire.\nAt any time thereafter, you can use your action to speak the item’s\nname and crush the sapphire. The item instantly appears in your hand\nregardless of physical or planar distances, and the spell ends.\nIf another creature is holding or carrying the item, crushing the\nsapphire doesn’t transport the item to you, but instead you learn\nwho the creature possessing the object is and roughly where that\ncreature is located at that moment.\nDispel magic or a similar\neffect successfully applied to the sapphire ends this spell’s\neffect.\nInvisibility\n2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an eyelash encased in gum arabic)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nA creature you touch becomes invisible until the spell ends.\nAnything the target is wearing or carrying is invisible as long as\nit is on the target’s person.

The target begins\na comic dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering\nfor the duration. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune to this\nspell.\nA dancing creature must use all its movement to dance without\nleaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws\nand attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other\ncreatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a\ndancing creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of\nitself. On a successful save, the spell ends."

The spell brings to\nyour mind a brief summary of the significant lore about the thing\nyou named. The lore might consist of current tales, forgotten\nstories, or even secret lore that has never been widely known. If\nthe thing you named isn’t of legendary importance, you gain no\ninformation.

The hand lasts for the duration or until you dismiss it as an\naction.

You can’t move\nor use reactions. The only action you can take is to project your\nsoul up to 100 feet out of the container, either returning to your\nliving body (and ending the spell) or attempting to possess a\nhumanoids body.\nYou can attempt to possess any humanoid within 100 feet of you that\nyou can see (creatures warded by a\nprotection\nfrom evil and good or\nmagic circle spell can’t\nbe possessed).

If the host body\ndies while you’re in it, the creature dies, and you must make a\nCharisma saving throw against your own spellcasting DC. On a\nsuccess, you return to the container if it is within 100 feet of\nyou. Otherwise, you die.\nIf the container is destroyed or the spell ends, your soul\nimmediately returns to your body. If your body is more than 100 feet\naway from you or if your body is dead when you attempt to return to\nit, you die. If another creature’s soul is in the container when it\nis destroyed, the creature’s soul returns to its body if the body is\nalive and within 100 feet. Otherwise, that creature dies.\nWhen the spell ends, the container is destroyed.\nMagic Missile\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create three glowing darts of magical force.

Finally, determine the\ncircumstance that will trigger the spell to deliver your message.\nWhen that circumstance occurs, a magical mouth appears on the object\nand recites the message in your voice and at the same volume you\nspoke. If the object you chose has a mouth or something that looks\nlike a mouth (for example, the mouth of a statue), the magical mouth\nappears there so that the words appear to come from the object’s\nmouth. When you cast this spell, you can have the spell end after it\ndelivers its message, or it can remain and repeat its message\nwhenever the trigger occurs.\nThe triggering circumstance can be as general or as detailed as you\nlike, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that\noccur within 30 feet of the object.

You\ncan open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it. While\nclosed, the portal is invisible.\nBeyond the portal is a magnificent foyer with numerous chambers\nbeyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm.\nYou can create any floor plan you like, but the space can’t exceed\n50 cubes, each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is\nfurnished and decorated as you choose. It contains sufficient food\nto serve a nine-course banquet for up to 100 people. A staff of 100\nnear-transparent servants attends all who enter. You decide the\nvisual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are\ncompletely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any\ntask a normal human servant could perform, but they can’t attack or\ntake any action that would directly harm another creature. Thus the\nservants can fetch things, clean, mend, fold clothes, light fires,\nserve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants can go anywhere in\nthe mansion but can’t leave it. Furnishings and other objects\ncreated by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the\nmansion. When the spell ends, any creatures inside the\nextradimensional space are expelled into the open spaces nearest to\nthe entrance.\nMajor Image\n3rd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible\nphenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears\nat a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration.\nIt seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature\nappropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat\nor cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage\nor deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like\na troglodyte’s stench).\nAs long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your\naction to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As\nthe image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its\nmovements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create\nan image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that\nit appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to\nmake different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a\nconversation, for example.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,\nbecause things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action\nto examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a\nsuccessful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell\nsave DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the\ncreature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities\nbecome faint to the creature. At Higher Levels. When you cast this\nspell using a spell slot of 6th level or higher, the spell lasts\nuntil dispelled, without requiring your concentration.\nMass Cure Wounds\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA wave of healing energy washes out from a point of your choice\nwithin range. Choose up to six creatures in a 30-foot-radius sphere\ncentered on that point. Each target regains hit points equal to 3d8\n+ your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on\nundead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 5th.\nMass Heal\n9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA flood of healing energy flows from you into injured creatures\naround you. You restore up to 700 hit points, divided as you choose\namong any number of creatures that you can see within range.\nCreatures healed by this spell are also cured of all diseases and\nany effect making them blinded\nor deafened. This spell has\nno effect on undead or constructs.\nMass Healing Word\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAs you call out words of restoration, up to six creatures of your\nchoice that you can see within range regain hit points equal to 1d4\n+ your spellcasting ability modifier. This spell has no effect on\nundead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, the healing increases by 1d4 for each slot\nlevel above 3rd.\nMass Suggestion\n6th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and\nmagically influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you\ncan see within range and that can hear and understand you. Creatures\nthat can’t be charmed are\nimmune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a\nmanner as to make the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the\ncreature to stab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself,\nor do some other obviously harmful act automatically negates the\neffect of the spell.\nEach target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it\npursues the course of action you described to the best of its\nability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire\nduration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter\ntime, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to\ndo.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity\nduring the duration. For example, you might suggest that a group of\nsoldiers give all their money to the first beggar they meet. If the\ncondition isn’t met before the spell ends, the activity isn’t\nperformed.\nIf you or any of your companions damage a creature affected by this\nspell, the spell ends for that creature.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level\nspell slot, the duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell\nslot, the duration is 30 days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot,\nthe duration is a year and a day.\nMaze\n8th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou banish a creature that you can see within range into a\nlabyrinthine demiplane. The\ntarget remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.\nThe target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so,\nit makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and\nthe spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically\nsucceeds). When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it\nleft or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.\nMeld into Stone\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou step into a stone object or surface large enough to fully\ncontain your body, melding yourself and all the equipment you carry\nwith the stone for the duration. Using your movement, you step into\nthe stone at a point you can touch. Nothing of your presence remains\nvisible or otherwise detectable by nonmagical senses.\nWhile merged with the stone, you can’t see what occurs outside it,\nand any Wisdom (Perception) checks you make to hear sounds outside\nit are made with disadvantage. You remain aware of the passage of\ntime and can cast spells on yourself while merged in the stone. You\ncan use your movement to leave the stone where you entered it, which\nends the spell. You otherwise can’t move.\nMinor physical damage to the stone doesn’t harm you, but its partial\ndestruction or a change in its shape (to the extent that you no\nlonger fit within it) expels you and deals 6d6 bludgeoning damage to\nyou. The stone’s complete destruction (or transmutation into a\ndifferent substance) expels you and deals 50 bludgeoning damage to\nyou. If expelled, you fall prone\nin an unoccupied space closest to where you first entered.\nMending\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (two lodestones)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch,\nsuch as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, a torn\ncloak, or a leaking wineskin. As long as the break or tear is no\nlarger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace\nof the former damage.\nThis spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the\nspell can’t restore magic to such an object.\nMessage\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of copper wire)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a\nmessage. The target (and only the target) hears the message and can\nreply in a whisper that only you can hear.\nYou can cast this spell through solid objects if you are familiar\nwith the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence,\n1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3\nfeet of wood blocks the spell. The spell doesn’t have to follow a\nstraight line and can travel freely around corners or through\nopenings.\nMeteor Swarm\n9th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 1 mile\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBlazing orbs of fire plummet to the ground at four different points\nyou can see within range. Each creature in a 40-foot-radius sphere\ncentered on each point you choose must make a Dexterity saving\nthrow. The sphere spreads around corners. A creature takes 20d6 fire\ndamage and 20d6 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much\ndamage on a successful one. A creature in the area of more than one\nfiery burst is affected only once.\nThe spell damages objects in the area and ignites flammable objects\nthat aren’t being worn or carried.\nMind Blank\n8th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 24 hours\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is immune to\npsychic damage, any effect that would sense its emotions or read its\nthoughts, divination spells, and the\ncharmed condition. The spell\neven foils wish spells and spells\nor effects of similar power used to affect the target’s mind or to\ngain information about the target.\nMinor Illusion\nIllusion cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts\nfor the duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an\naction or cast this spell again.\nIf you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a\nscream. It can be your voice, someone else’s voice, a lion’s roar, a\nbeating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues\nunabated throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at\ndifferent times before the spell ends.\nIf you create an image of an object—such as a chair, muddy\nfootprints, or a small chest—it must be no larger than a\n5-foot cube. The image can’t create sound, light, smell, or any\nother sensory effect. Physical interaction with the image reveals it\nto be an illusion, because things can pass through it.\nIf a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the\ncreature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful\nIntelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a\ncreature discerns the illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes\nfaint to the creature.\nMirage Arcane\n7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Sight\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 days\nYou make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell,\nand even feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain’s general\nshape remains the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made\nto resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or\nimpassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow,\na precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide\nand smooth road.\nSimilarly, you can alter the appearance of structures, or add them\nwhere none are present. The spell doesn’t disguise, conceal, or add\ncreatures.\nThe illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and olfactory\nelements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or\nvice versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece\nof the illusory terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed\nfrom the spell’s area disappears immediately.\nCreatures with truesight can see through the illusion to the\nterrain’s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion\nremain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion’s presence,\nthe creature can still physically interact with the illusion.\nMirror Image\n2nd-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nThree illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until\nthe spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions,\nshifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real.\nYou can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.\nEach time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s\nduration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets\none of your duplicates.\nIf you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change\nthe attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must\nroll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or\nhigher.\nA duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack\nhits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be\ndestroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other\ndamage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are\ndestroyed.\nA creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies\non senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can\nperceive illusions as false, as with truesight.\nMislead\n5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou become invisible at the\nsame time that an illusory double of you appears where you are\nstanding. The double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility\nends if you attack or cast a spell.\nYou can use your action to move your illusory double up to twice\nyour speed and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way\nyou choose.\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you\nwere located where it is. On each of your turns as a bonus action,\nyou can switch from using its senses to using your own, or back\nagain. While you are using its senses, you are\nblinded and\ndeafened in regard to your\nown surroundings.\nMisty Step\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBriefly surrounded by silvery mist, you teleport up to 30 feet to an\nunoccupied space that you can see.\nModify Memory\n5th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature\nthat you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are\nfighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a\nfailed save, the target becomes\ncharmed by you for the\nduration. The charmed target is\nincapacitated and\nunaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it\ntakes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends,\nand none of the target’s memories are modified.\nWhile this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an\nevent that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted\nno more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of\nthe event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity\nand exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event,\nor create a memory of some other event.\nYou must speak to the target to describe how its memories are\naffected, and it must be able to understand your language for the\nmodified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the\ndetails of your description. If the spell ends before you have\nfinished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory\nisn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the\nspell ends.\nA modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves,\nparticularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural\ninclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory,\nsuch as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing\nitself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The GM might\ndeem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a\nsignificant manner.\nA remove curse or greater restoration\nspell cast on the target restores the creature’s true memory.\nAt Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 6th level or higher, you can alter the target’s memories of an\nevent that took place up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th\nlevel), 1 year ago (8th level), or any time in the creature’s past\n(9th level).\nMoonbeam\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (several seeds of any moonseed plant and a piece of opalescent feldspar)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot-radius,\n40-foot-high cylinder centered on a point within range. Until the\nspell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.\nWhen a creature enters the spell’s area for the first time on a turn\nor starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that\ncause searing pain, and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It\ntakes 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage\non a successful one.\nA shapechanger makes its saving throw with disadvantage. If it\nfails, it also instantly reverts to its original form and can’t\nassume a different form until it leaves the spell’s light.\nOn each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can use an\naction to move the beam 60 feet in any direction.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot\nlevel above 2nd.\nMove Earth\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (an iron blade and a small bag containing a mixture of soils—clay, loam, and sand)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 2 hours\nChoose an area of terrain no larger than 40 feet on a side within\nrange. You can reshape dirt, sand, or clay in the area in any manner\nyou choose for the duration. You can raise or lower the area’s\nelevation, create or fill in a trench, erect or flatten a wall, or\nform a pillar. The extent of any such changes can’t exceed half the\narea’s largest dimension. So, if you affect a 40-foot square, you\ncan create a pillar up to 20 feet high, raise or lower the square’s\nelevation by up to 20 feet, dig a trench up to 20 feet deep, and so\non. It takes 10 minutes for these changes to complete.\nAt the end of every 10 minutes you spend concentrating on the spell,\nyou can choose a new area of terrain to affect.\nBecause the terrain’s transformation occurs slowly, creatures in the\narea can’t usually be trapped or injured by the ground’s movement.\nThis spell can’t manipulate natural stone or stone construction.\nRocks and structures shift to accommodate the new terrain. If the\nway you shape the terrain would make a structure unstable, it might\ncollapse.\nSimilarly, this spell doesn’t directly affect plant growth. The\nmoved earth carries any plants along with it."

For the duration, each creature you\nchoose within 30 feet of you (including you) has a +10 bonus to\nDexterity (Stealth) checks and can’t be tracked except by magical\nmeans. A creature that receives this bonus leaves behind no tracks\nor other traces of its passage.\nPasswall\n5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of sesame seeds)\nDuration: 1 hour\nA passage appears at a point of your choice that you can see on a\nwooden, plaster, or stone surface (such as a wall, a ceiling, or a\nfloor) within range, and lasts for the duration. You choose the\nopening’s dimensions: up to 5 feet wide, 8 feet tall, and 20 feet\ndeep. The passage creates no instability in a structure surrounding\nit.\nWhen the opening disappears, any creatures or objects still in the\npassage created by the spell are safely ejected to an unoccupied\nspace nearest to the surface on which you cast the spell.\nPhantasmal Killer\n4th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou tap into the nightmares of a creature you can see within range\nand create an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible\nonly to that creature. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw.\nOn a failed save, the target becomes\nfrightened for the\nduration. At the end of each of the target’s turns before the spell\nends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10\npsychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. At Higher\nLevels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or\nhigher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 4th.\nPhantom Steed\n3rd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nA Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an\nunoccupied space of your choice within range. You decide the\ncreature’s appearance, but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and\nbridle. Any of the equipment created by the spell vanishes in a puff\nof smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away from the steed.\nFor the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed.\nThe creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a\nspeed of 100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at\na fast pace. When the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving\nthe rider 1 minute to dismount. The spell ends if you use an action\nto dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage.\nPlanar Ally\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou beseech an otherworldly entity for aid. The being must be known\nto you: a god, a primordial, a demon prince, or some other being of\ncosmic power. That entity sends a celestial, an elemental, or a\nfiend loyal to it to aid you, making the creature appear in an\nunoccupied space within range. If you know a specific creature’s\nname, you can speak that name when you cast this spell to request\nthat creature, though you might get a different creature anyway\n(GM’s choice).\nWhen the creature appears, it is under no compulsion to behave in\nany particular way. You can ask the creature to perform a service in\nexchange for payment, but it isn’t obliged to do so. The requested\ntask could range from simple (fly us across the chasm, or help us\nfight a battle) to complex (spy on our enemies, or protect us during\nour foray into the dungeon). You must be able to communicate with\nthe creature to bargain for its services.\nPayment can take a variety of forms. A celestial might require a\nsizable donation of gold or magic items to an allied temple, while a\nfiend might demand a living sacrifice or a gift of treasure. Some\ncreatures might exchange their service for a quest undertaken by\nyou.\nAs a rule of thumb, a task that can be measured in minutes requires\na payment worth 100 gp per minute. A task measured in hours requires\n1,000 gp per hour. And a task measured in days (up to 10 days)\nrequires 10,000 gp per day. The GM can adjust these payments based\non the circumstances under which you cast the spell. If the task is\naligned with the creature’s ethos, the payment might be halved or\neven waived. Nonhazardous tasks typically require only half the\nsuggested payment, while especially dangerous tasks might require a\ngreater gift. Creatures rarely accept tasks that seem suicidal.\nAfter the creature completes the task, or when the agreed-upon\nduration of service expires, the creature returns to its home plane\nafter reporting back to you, if appropriate to the task and if\npossible. If you are unable to agree on a price for the creature’s\nservice, the creature immediately returns to its home plane.\nA creature enlisted to join your group counts as a member of it,\nreceiving a full share of experience points awarded.\nPlanar Binding\n5th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a jewel worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 24 hours\nWith this spell, you attempt to bind a celestial, an elemental, a\nfey, or a fiend to your service. The creature must be within range\nfor the entire casting of the spell. (Typically, the creature is\nfirst summoned into the center of an inverted\nmagic circle in order to\nkeep it trapped while this spell is cast.) At the completion of the\ncasting, the target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed\nsave, it is bound to serve you for the duration. If the creature was\nsummoned or created by another spell, that spell’s duration is\nextended to match the duration of this spell.\nA bound creature must follow your instructions to the best of its\nability. You might command the creature to accompany you on an\nadventure, to guard a location, or to deliver a message. The\ncreature obeys the letter of your instructions, but if the creature\nis hostile to you, it strives to twist your words to achieve its own\nobjectives. If the creature carries out your instructions completely\nbefore the spell ends, it travels to you to report this fact if you\nare on the same plane of existence. If you are on a different plane\nof existence, it returns to the place where you bound it and remains\nthere until the spell ends.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof a higher level, the duration increases to 10 days with a\n6th-level slot, to 30 days with a 7th-level slot, to 180 days with\nan 8th-level slot, and to a year and a day with a 9th-level spell\nslot.\nPlane Shift\n7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a forked, metal rod worth at least 250 gp, attuned to a particular plane of existence)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near that destination.  If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example, you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the GM’s discretion.\nAlternatively, if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest unoccupied spaces next to the circle.\nYou can use this spell to banish an unwilling creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw. If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way back to your current plane of existence.\nPlant Growth\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action or 8 hours\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area.\nThere are two possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate\nor long-term benefits.\nIf you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range.\nAll normal plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become\nthick and overgrown. A creature moving through the area must spend 4\nfeet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.\nYou can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell’s\narea from being affected.\nIf you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the land. All plants\nin a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become\nenriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of\nfood when harvested.\nPolymorph\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a caterpillar cocoon)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nThis spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into\na new form. An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to\navoid the effect. The spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a\ncreature with 0 hit points.\nThe transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops\nto 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast whose\nchallenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or the\ntarget’s level, if it doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s\ngame statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by\nthe statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and\npersonality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts\nto its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points\nit had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping\nto 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.\nAs long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the creature’s normal\nform to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked unconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature\nof its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other\naction that requires hands or speech.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t\nactivate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its\nequipment.\nPower Word Kill\n9th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou utter a word of power that can compel one creature you can see\nwithin range to die instantly. If the creature you choose has 100\nhit points or fewer, it dies. Otherwise, the spell has no effect.\nPower Word Stun\n8th-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one\ncreature you can see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the\ntarget has 150 hit points or fewer, it is\nstunned. Otherwise, the spell\nhas no effect.\nThe stunned target must make a Constitution saving throw at the end\nof each of its turns. On a successful save, this stunning effect\nends.\nPrayer of Healing\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nUp to six creatures of your choice that you can see within range\neach regain hit points equal to 2d8 + your spellcasting ability\nmodifier. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, the healing increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 2nd.\nPrestidigitation\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Up to 1 hour\nThis spell is a minor magical trick that novice spellcasters use for\npractice. You create one of the following magical effects within\nrange:\nYou create an instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as a\nshower of sparks, a puff of wind, faint musical notes, or an odd\nodor.\nYou instantaneously light or snuff out a candle, a torch, or a\nsmall campfire.\nYou instantaneously clean or soil an object no larger than 1 cubic\nfoot.\nYou chill, warm, or flavor up to 1 cubic foot of nonliving\nmaterial for 1 hour.\nYou make a color, a small mark, or a symbol appear on an object or\na surface for 1 hour.\nYou create a nonmagical trinket or an illusory image that can fit\nin your hand and that lasts until the end of your next turn.\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of\nits non-instantaneous effects active at a time, and you can dismiss\nsuch an effect as an action.\nPrismatic Spray\n7th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot cone)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nEight multicolored rays of light flash from your hand. Each ray is a\ndifferent color and has a different power and purpose. Each creature\nin a 60-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. For each\ntarget, roll a d8 to determine which color ray affects it.\nRed. The target takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half\nas much damage on a successful one.\nOrange. The target takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one.\nYellow. The target takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save,\nor half as much damage on a successful one.\nGreen. The target takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed save, or\nhalf as much damage on a successful one.\nBlue. The target takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half\nas much damage on a successful one.\nIndigo. On a failed save, the target is\nrestrained. It must then\nmake a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns.\nIf it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If it fails\nits save three times, it permanently turns to stone and is\nsubjected to the petrified\ncondition. The successes and failures don’t need to be\nconsecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of\na kind.\nViolet. On a failed save, the target is\nblinded. It must then make a\nWisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful\nsave ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is\ntransported to another plane of existence of the GM’s choosing and\nis no longer blinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane\nthat isn’t its home plane is banished home, while other creatures\nare usually cast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.)\nSpecial. The target is struck by two rays. Roll twice more,\nrerolling any 8.\nPrismatic Wall\n9th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nA shimmering, multicolored plane of light forms a vertical opaque\nwall—up to 90 feet long, 30 feet high, and 1 inch\nthick—centered on a point you can see within range.\nAlternatively, you can shape the wall into a sphere up to 30 feet in\ndiameter centered on a point you choose within range. The wall\nremains in place for the duration. If you position the wall so that\nit passes through a space occupied by a creature, the spell fails,\nand your action and the spell slot are wasted.\nThe wall sheds bright light out to a range of 100 feet and dim light\nfor an additional 100 feet. You and creatures you designate at the\ntime you cast the spell can pass through and remain near the wall\nwithout harm. If another creature that can see the wall moves to\nwithin 20 feet of it or starts its turn there, the creature must\nsucceed on a Constitution saving throw or become\nblinded for 1 minute.\nThe wall consists of seven layers, each with a different color. When\na creature attempts to reach into or pass through the wall, it does\nso one layer at a time through all the wall’s layers. As it passes\nor reaches through each layer, the creature must make a Dexterity\nsaving throw or be affected by that layer’s properties as described\nbelow.\nThe wall can be destroyed, also one layer at a time, in order from\nred to violet, by means specific to each layer. Once a layer is\ndestroyed, it remains so for the duration of the spell. A\nrod of cancellation destroys a\nprismatic wall, but an\nantimagic field has no\neffect on it.\nRed. The creature takes 10d6 fire damage on a failed save,\nor half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer is in\nplace, nonmagical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall. The\nlayer can be destroyed by dealing at least 25 cold damage to it.\nOrange. The creature takes 10d6 acid damage on a failed\nsave, or half as much damage on a successful one. While this layer\nis in place, magical ranged attacks can’t pass through the wall.\nThe layer is destroyed by a strong wind.\nYellow. The creature takes 10d6 lightning damage on a\nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. This\nlayer can be destroyed by dealing at least 60 force damage to it.\nGreen. The creature takes 10d6 poison damage on a failed\nsave, or half as much damage on a successful one. A passwall spell, or another\nspell of equal or greater level that can open a portal on a solid\nsurface, destroys this layer.\nBlue. The creature takes 10d6 cold damage on a failed save,\nor half as much damage on a successful one. This layer can be\ndestroyed by dealing at least 25 fire damage to it.\nIndigo. On a failed save, the creature is\nrestrained. It must\nthen make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its\nturns. If it successfully saves three times, the spell ends. If\nit fails its save three times, it permanently turns to stone and\nis subjected to the\npetrified condition. The\nsuccesses and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track\nof both until the creature collects three of a kind.\nWhile this layer is in place, spells can’t be cast through the\nwall. The layer is destroyed by bright light shed by a\ndaylight spell or a\nsimilar spell of equal or higher level.\nViolet. On a failed save, the creature is blinded. It must then make a\nWisdom saving throw at the start of your next turn. A successful\nsave ends the blindness. If it fails that save, the creature is\ntransported to another plane of the GM’s choosing and is no longer\nblinded. (Typically, a creature that is on a plane that isn’t its\nhome plane is banished home, while other creatures are usually\ncast into the Astral or Ethereal planes.) This layer is destroyed\nby a dispel magic spell\nor a similar spell of equal or higher level that can end spells\nand magical effects.\nPrivate Sanctum\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a thin sheet of lead, a piece of opaque glass, a wad of cotton or cloth, and powdered chrysolite)\nDuration: 24 hours\nYou make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube\nthat can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side.\nThe spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to\ndismiss it.\nWhen you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell\nprovides, choosing any or all of the following properties:\nSound can’t pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded\narea.\nThe barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing\nvision (including darkvision) through it.\nSensors created by divination spells can’t appear inside the\nprotected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.\nCreatures in the area can’t be targeted by divination spells.\nNothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.\nPlanar travel is blocked within the warded area.\nCasting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this\neffect permanent.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100\nfeet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube\nthat can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th\nlevel.\nProduce Flame\nConjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nA flickering flame appears in your hand. The flame remains there for\nthe duration and harms neither you nor your equipment. The flame\nsheds bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an\nadditional 10 feet. The spell ends if you dismiss it as an action or\nif you cast it again.\nYou can also attack with the flame, although doing so ends the\nspell. When you cast this spell, or as an action on a later turn,\nyou can hurl the flame at a creature within 30 feet of you. Make a\nranged spell attack. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 fire damage.\nThis spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),\n11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nProgrammed Illusion\n6th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece and jade dust worth at least 25 gp)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other\nvisible phenomenon within range that activates when a specific\ncondition occurs. The illusion is imperceptible until then. It must\nbe no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide when you cast the\nspell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This\nscripted performance can last up to 5 minutes.\nWhen the condition you specify occurs, the illusion springs into\nexistence and performs in the manner you described. Once the\nillusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for\n10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again.\nThe triggering condition can be as general or as detailed as you\nlike, though it must be based on visual or audible conditions that\noccur within 30 feet of the area. For example, you could create an\nillusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt to\nopen a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only\nwhen a creature says the correct word or phrase.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,\nbecause things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action\nto examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a\nsuccessful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell\nsave DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the\ncreature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds\nhollow to the creature.\nProject Image\n7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 500 miles\nComponents: V, S, M (a small replica of you made from materials worth at least 5 gp)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 day\nYou create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration.\nThe copy can appear at any location within range that you have seen\nbefore, regardless of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and\nsounds like you but is intangible. If the illusion takes any damage,\nit disappears, and the spell ends.\nYou can use your action to move this illusion up to twice your\nspeed, and make it gesture, speak, and behave in whatever way you\nchoose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.\nYou can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you\nwere in its space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch\nfrom using its senses to using your own, or back again. While you\nare using its senses, you are\nblinded and\ndeafened in regard to your\nown surroundings.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,\nbecause things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action\nto examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a\nsuccessful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell\nsave DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the\ncreature can see through the image, and any noise it makes sounds\nhollow to the creature.\nProtection from Energy\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nFor the duration, the willing creature you touch has resistance to\none damage type of your choice: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or\nthunder.\nProtection from Evil and Good\n1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (holy water or powdered silver and iron, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration up to 10 minutes\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected\nagainst certain types of creatures: aberrations, celestials,\nelementals, fey, fiends, and undead.\nThe protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types\nhave disadvantage on attack rolls against the target. The target\nalso can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by them. If the\ntarget is already charmed, frightened, or possessed by such a\ncreature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against\nthe relevant effect.\nProtection from Poison\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a creature. If it is poisoned, you neutralize the\npoison. If more than one poison afflicts the target, you neutralize\none poison that you know is present, or you neutralize one at\nrandom.\nFor the duration, the target has advantage on saving throws against\nbeing poisoned, and it has resistance to poison damage.\nPurify Food and Drink\n1st-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAll nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered\non a point of your choice within range is purified and rendered free\nof poison and disease."

If the creature’s soul is both\nwilling and at liberty to rejoin the body, the creature returns to\nlife with 1 hit point.\nThis spell also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical\ndiseases that affected the creature at the time it died. This spell\ndoesn’t, however, remove magical diseases, curses, or similar\neffects; if these aren’t first removed prior to casting the spell,\nthey take effect when the creature returns to life. The spell can’t\nreturn an undead creature to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds, but it doesn’t restore missing\nbody parts. If the creature is lacking body parts or organs integral\nfor its survival—its head, for instance—the spell\nautomatically fails.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4\npenalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.\nEvery time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced\nby 1 until it disappears.\nRay of Enfeeblement\n2nd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a\ncreature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the\ntarget. On a hit, the target deals only half damage with weapon\nattacks that use Strength until the spell ends.\nAt the end of each of the target’s turns, it can make a Constitution\nsaving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends.\nRay of Frost\nEvocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within\nrange. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, it\ntakes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the\nstart of your next turn.\nThe spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),\n11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nRegenerate\n7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a prayer wheel and holy water)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The\ntarget regains 4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell,\nthe target regains 1 hit point at the start of each of its turns (10\nhit points each minute).\nThe target’s severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on),\nif any, are restored after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part\nand hold it to the stump, the spell instantaneously causes the limb\nto knit to the stump.\nReincarnate\n5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (rare oils and unguents worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided\nthat the creature has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell\nforms a new adult body for it and then calls the soul to enter that\nbody. If the target’s soul isn’t free or willing to do so, the spell\nfails.\nThe magic fashions a new body for the creature to inhabit, which\nlikely causes the creature’s race to change. The GM rolls a d100 and\nconsults the following table to determine what form the creature\ntakes when restored to life, or the GM chooses a form.\nd100\nRace\n01–04\nDragonborn\n05–13\nDwarf, hill\n14–21\nDwarf, mountain\n22–25\nElf, dark\n26–34\nElf, high\n35–42\nElf, wood\n43–46\nGnome, forest\n47–52\nGnome, rock\n53–56\nHalf-elf\n57–60\nHalf-orc\n61–68\nHalfling, lightfoot\n69–76\nHalfling, stout\n77–96\nHuman\n97–00\nTiefling\nThe reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences.\nIt retains the capabilities it had in its original form, except it\nexchanges its original race for the new one and changes its racial\ntraits accordingly.\nRemove Curse\n3rd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nAt your touch, all curses affecting one creature or object end. If\nthe object is a cursed magic item, its curse remains, but the spell\nbreaks its owner’s attunement to the object so it can be removed or\ndiscarded.\nResilient Sphere\n4th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a hemispherical piece of clear crystal and a matching hemispherical piece of gum arabic)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large\nsize or smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is enclosed\nfor the duration.\nNothing—not physical objects, energy, or other spell\neffects—can pass through the barrier, in or out, though a\ncreature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune to\nall damage, and a creature or object inside can’t be damaged by\nattacks or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature\ninside the sphere damage anything outside it.\nThe sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain the\ncreature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action\nto push against the sphere’s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to\nhalf the creature’s speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and\nmoved by other creatures.\nA disintegrate spell\ntargeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it.\nResistance\nAbjuration cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a miniature cloak)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou touch one willing creature. Once before the spell ends, the\ntarget can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to one saving throw\nof its choice. It can roll the die before or after making the saving\nthrow. The spell then ends.\nResurrection\n7th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a diamond worth at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a dead creature that has been dead for no more than a\ncentury, that didn’t die of old age, and that isn’t undead. If its\nsoul is free and willing, the target returns to life with all its\nhit points.\nThis spell neutralizes any poisons and cures normal diseases\nafflicting the creature when it died. It doesn’t, however, remove\nmagical diseases, curses, and the like; if such effects aren’t\nremoved prior to casting the spell, they afflict the target on its\nreturn to life.\nThis spell closes all mortal wounds and restores any missing body\nparts.\nComing back from the dead is an ordeal. The target takes a −4\npenalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks.\nEvery time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced\nby 1 until it disappears.\nCasting this spell to restore life to a creature that has been dead\nfor one year or longer taxes you greatly. Until you finish a long\nrest, you can’t cast spells again, and you have disadvantage on all\nattack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws.\nReverse Gravity\n7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 100 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a lodestone and iron filings)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nThis spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100-foot high\ncylinder centered on a point within range. All creatures and objects\nthat aren’t somehow anchored to the ground in the area fall upward\nand reach the top of the area when you cast this spell. A creature\ncan make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a fixed object it can\nreach, thus avoiding the fall. If some solid object (such as a\nceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures\nstrike it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an\nobject or creature reaches the top of the area without striking\nanything, it remains there, oscillating slightly, for the duration.\nAt the end of the duration, affected objects and creatures fall back\ndown.\nRevivify\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamonds worth 300 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a creature that has died within the last minute. That\ncreature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell can’t return\nto life a creature that has died of old age, nor can it restore any\nmissing body parts.\nRope Trick\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (powdered corn extract and a twisted loop of parchment)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of\nthe rope then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs\nperpendicular to the ground. At the upper end of the rope, an\ninvisible entrance opens to an extradimensional space that lasts\nuntil the spell ends.\nThe extradimensional space can be reached by climbing to the top of\nthe rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium or smaller\ncreatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope\ndisappear from view outside the space.\nAttacks and spells can’t cross through the entrance into or out of\nthe extradimensional space, but those inside can see out of it as if\nthrough a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope.\nAnything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell\nends."

The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take\n1d8 radiant damage. The target gains no benefit from cover for this\nsaving throw.\nThe spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),\n11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nSanctuary\n1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small silver mirror)\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou ward a creature within range against attack. Until the spell\nends, any creature who targets the warded creature with an attack or\na harmful spell must first make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed\nsave, the creature must choose a new target or lose the attack or\nspell. This spell doesn’t protect the warded creature from area\neffects, such as the explosion of a fireball.\nIf the warded creature makes an attack or casts a spell that affects\nan enemy creature, this spell ends.\nScorching Ray\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou create three rays of fire and hurl them at targets within range.\nYou can hurl them at one target or several.\nMake a ranged spell attack for each ray. On a hit, the target takes\n2d6 fire damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, you create one additional ray for each slot\nlevel above 2nd.\nScrying\n5th-level divination\nCasting Time: 10 minutes\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a focus worth at least 1,000 gp, such as a crystal ball, a silver mirror, or a font filled with holy water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the\nsame plane of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving\nthrow, which is modified by how well you know the target and the\nsort of physical connection you have to it. If a target knows you’re\ncasting this spell, it can fail the saving throw voluntarily if it\nwants to be observed.\nKnowledge\nSave Modifier\nSecondhand (you have heard of the target)\n+5\nFirsthand (you have met the target)\n+0\nFamiliar (you know the target well)\n−5\nConnection\nSave Modifier\nLikeness or picture\n−2\nPossession or garment\n−4\nBody part, lock of hair, bit of nail, or the like\n−10\nOn a successful save, the target isn’t affected, and you can’t use\nthis spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the\nspell creates an invisible sensor within 10 feet of the target. You\ncan see and hear through the sensor as if you were there. The sensor\nmoves with the target, remaining within 10 feet of it for the\nduration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor\nas a luminous orb about the size of your fist.\nInstead of targeting a creature, you can choose a location you have\nseen before as the target of this spell. When you do, the sensor\nappears at that location and doesn’t move.\nSecret Chest\n4th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an exquisite chest, 3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet, constructed from rare materials worth at least 5,000 gp, and a Tiny replica made from the same materials worth at least 50 gp)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane.

The chest can contain up to 12\ncubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet by 2 feet by 2 feet).\nWhile the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can use an action\nand touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an\nunoccupied space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send\nthe chest back to the Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching\nboth the chest and the replica.\nAfter 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that\nthe spell’s effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell\nagain, if the smaller replica chest is destroyed, or if you choose\nto end the spell as an action. If the spell ends and the larger\nchest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.\nSee Invisibility\n2nd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of talc and a small sprinkling of powdered silver)\nDuration: 1 hour\nFor the duration, you see invisible creatures and objects as if they\nwere visible, and you can see into the Ethereal Plane. Ethereal\ncreatures and objects appear ghostly and translucent.\nSeeming\n5th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 8 hours\nThis spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of\ncreatures that you can see within range. You give each target you\nchoose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a\nCharisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this\nspell.\nThe spell disguises physical appearance as well as clothing, armor,\nweapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot\nshorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t\nchange a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the\nsame basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the\nillusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you\nuse your action to dismiss it sooner.\nThe changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical\ninspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a\ncreature’s outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who\ntouches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and\nhair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand\nof someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it\nwas seemingly still in midair.\nA creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an\nIntelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it\nsucceeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.\nSending\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Unlimited\nComponents: V, S, M (a short piece of fine copper wire)\nDuration: 1 round\nYou send a short message of twenty-five words or less to a creature\nwith which you are familiar. The creature hears the message in its\nmind, recognizes you as the sender if it knows you, and can answer\nin a like manner immediately. The spell enables creatures with\nIntelligence scores of at least 1 to understand the meaning of your\nmessage.\nYou can send the message across any distance and even to other\nplanes of existence, but if the target is on a different plane than\nyou, there is a 5 percent chance that the message doesn’t arrive.\nSequester\n7th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a powder composed of diamond, emerald, ruby, and sapphire dust worth at least 5,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nBy means of this spell, a willing creature or an object can be\nhidden away, safe from detection for the duration. When you cast the\nspell and touch the target, it becomes\ninvisible and can’t be\ntargeted by divination spells or perceived through scrying sensors\ncreated by divination spells.\nIf the target is a creature, it falls into a state of suspended\nanimation. Time ceases to flow for it, and it doesn’t grow older.\nYou can set a condition for the spell to end early. The condition\ncan be anything you choose, but it must occur or be visible within 1\nmile of the target. Examples include after 1,000 years or\nwhen the tarrasque awakens. This spell also ends if the\ntarget takes any damage.\nShapechange\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S, M (a jade circlet worth at least 1,500 gp, which you must place on your head before you cast the spell)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou assume the form of a different creature for the duration. The\nnew form can be of any creature with a challenge rating equal to\nyour level or lower. The creature can’t be a construct or an undead,\nand you must have seen the sort of creature at least once. You\ntransform into an average example of that creature, one without any\nclass levels or the Spellcasting trait.\nYour game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the chosen\ncreature, though you retain your alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom,\nand Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving\nthrow proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.\nIf the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus listed\nin its statistics is higher than yours, use the creature’s bonus in\nplace of yours. You can’t use any legendary actions or lair actions\nof the new form.\nYou assume the hit points and Hit Dice of the new form. When you\nrevert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points\nyou had before you transformed. If you revert as a result of\ndropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your\nnormal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce your normal\nform to 0 hit points, you aren’t knocked unconscious.\nYou retain the benefit of any features from your class, race, or\nother source and can use them, provided that your new form is\nphysically capable of doing so. You can’t use any special senses you\nhave (for example, darkvision) unless your new form also has that\nsense. You can only speak if the creature can normally speak.\nWhen you transform, you choose whether your equipment falls to the\nground, merges into the new form, or is worn by it. Worn equipment\nfunctions as normal. The GM determines whether it is practical for\nthe new form to wear a piece of equipment, based on the creature’s\nshape and size. Your equipment doesn’t change shape or size to match\nthe new form, and any equipment that the new form can’t wear must\neither fall to the ground or merge into your new form. Equipment\nthat merges has no effect in that state.\nDuring this spell’s duration, you can use your action to assume a\ndifferent form following the same restrictions and rules for the\noriginal form, with one exception: if your new form has more hit\npoints than your current one, your hit points remain at their\ncurrent value.\nShatter\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a chip of mica)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA sudden loud ringing noise, painfully intense, erupts from a point\nof your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius\nsphere centered on that point must make a Constitution saving throw.\nA creature takes 3d8 thunder damage on a failed save, or half as\nmuch damage on a successful one. A creature made of inorganic\nmaterial such as stone, crystal, or metal has disadvantage on this\nsaving throw.\nA nonmagical object that isn’t being worn or carried also takes the\ndamage if it’s in the spell’s area.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 2nd.\nShield\n1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nAn invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you.\nUntil the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC,\nincluding against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from\nmagic missile.\nShield of Faith\n1st-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small parchment with a bit of holy text written on it)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA shimmering field appears and surrounds a creature of your choice\nwithin range, granting it a +2 bonus to AC for the duration.\nShillelagh\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (mistletoe, a shamrock leaf, and a club or quarterstaff)\nDuration: 1 minute\nThe wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with\nnature’s power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting\nability instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls of melee\nattacks using that weapon, and the weapon’s damage die becomes a d8.\nThe weapon also becomes magical, if it isn’t already. The spell ends\nif you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon.\nShocking Grasp\nEvocation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nLightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature\nyou try to touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You\nhave advantage on the attack roll if the target is wearing armor\nmade of metal. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 lightning damage, and\nit can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.\nThe spell’s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8),\n11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8).\nSilence\n2nd-level illusion (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nFor the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a\n20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range.\nAny creature or object entirely inside the sphere is immune to\nthunder damage, and creatures are\ndeafened while entirely\ninside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is\nimpossible there.\nSilent Image\n1st-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of fleece)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible\nphenomenon that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears\nat a spot within range and lasts for the duration. The image is\npurely visual; it isn’t accompanied by sound, smell, or other\nsensory effects.\nYou can use your action to cause the image to move to any spot\nwithin range. As the image changes location, you can alter its\nappearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For\nexample, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can\nalter the image so that it appears to be walking.\nPhysical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion,\nbecause things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action\nto examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a\nsuccessful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell\nsave DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the\ncreature can see through the image.\nSimulacrum\n7th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 12 hours\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (snow or ice in quantities sufficient to made a life-size copy of the duplicated creature; some hair, fingernail clippings, or other piece of that creature’s body placed inside the snow or ice; and powdered ruby worth 1,500 gp, sprinkled over the duplicate and consumed by the spell)\nDuration: Until dispelled\nYou shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is\nwithin range for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate\nis a creature, partially real and formed from ice or snow, and it\ncan take actions and otherwise be affected as a normal creature. It\nappears to be the same as the original, but it has half the\ncreature’s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment.\nOtherwise, the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it\nduplicates.\nThe simulacrum is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It\nobeys your spoken commands, moving and acting in accordance with\nyour wishes and acting on your turn in combat. The simulacrum lacks\nthe ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never increases\nits level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell\nslots.\nIf the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical\nlaboratory, using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point\nit regains. The simulacrum lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at\nwhich point it reverts to snow and melts instantly.\nIf you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you\ncreated with this spell are instantly destroyed.\nSleep\n1st-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of fine sand, rose petals, or a cricket)\nDuration: 1 minute\nThis spell sends creatures into a magical slumber. Roll 5d8; the\ntotal is how many hit points of creatures this spell can affect.\nCreatures within 20 feet of a point you choose within range are\naffected in ascending order of their current hit points (ignoring unconscious creatures).\nStarting with the creature that has the lowest current hit points,\neach creature affected by this spell falls unconscious until the\nspell ends, the sleeper takes damage, or someone uses an action to\nshake or slap the sleeper awake. Subtract each creature’s hit points\nfrom the total before moving on to the creature with the next lowest\nhit points. A creature’s hit points must be equal to or less than\nthe remaining total for that creature to be affected.\nUndead and creatures immune to being charmed aren’t affected by this\nspell.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, roll an additional 2d8 for each slot level\nabove 1st.\nSleet Storm\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of dust and a few drops of water)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nUntil the spell ends, freezing rain and sleet fall in a 20-foot-tall\ncylinder with a 40-foot radius centered on a point you choose within\nrange. The area is heavily obscured, and exposed flames in the area\nare doused.\nThe ground in the area is covered with slick ice, making it\ndifficult terrain. When a creature enters the spell’s area for the\nfirst time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, it falls prone.\nIf a creature is concentrating in the spell’s area, the creature\nmust make a successful Constitution saving throw against your spell\nsave DC or lose concentration.\nSlow\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of molasses)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou alter time around up to six creatures of your choice in a\n40-foot cube within range. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom\nsaving throw or be affected by this spell for the duration.\nAn affected target’s speed is halved, it takes a −2 penalty to\nAC and Dexterity saving throws, and it can’t use reactions. On its\nturn, it can use either an action or a bonus action, not both.\nRegardless of the creature’s abilities or magic items, it can’t make\nmore than one melee or ranged attack during its turn.\nIf the creature attempts to cast a spell with a casting time of 1\naction, roll a d20. On an 11 or higher, the spell doesn’t take\neffect until the creature’s next turn, and the creature must use its\naction on that turn to complete the spell. If it can’t, the spell is\nwasted.\nA creature affected by this spell makes another Wisdom saving throw\nat the end of its turn. On a successful save, the effect ends for\nit.\nSpeak with Animals\n1st-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with\nbeasts for the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts\nis limited by their intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give\nyou information about nearby locations and monsters, including\nwhatever they can perceive or have perceived within the past day.\nYou might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for\nyou, at the GM’s discretion.\nSpeak with Dead\n3rd-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (burning incense)\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your\nchoice within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose.\nThe corpse must still have a mouth and can’t be undead. The spell\nfails if the corpse was the target of this spell within the last 10\ndays.\nUntil the spell ends, you can ask the corpse up to five questions.\nThe corpse knows only what it knew in life, including the languages\nit knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive, and the\ncorpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are\nhostile to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn’t\nreturn the creature’s soul to its body, only its animating spirit.\nThus, the corpse can’t learn new information, doesn’t comprehend\nanything that has happened since it died, and can’t speculate about\nfuture events.\nSpeak with Plants\n3rd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (30-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 10 minutes\nYou imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and\nanimation, giving them the ability to communicate with you and\nfollow your simple commands. You can question plants about events in\nthe spell’s area within the past day, gaining information about\ncreatures that have passed, weather, and other circumstances.\nYou can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such as\nthickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the\nduration. Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present\ninto difficult terrain that lasts for the duration, causing vines\nand branches to hinder pursuers, for example.\nPlants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the\nGM’s discretion. The spell doesn’t enable plants to uproot\nthemselves and move about, but they can freely move branches,\ntendrils, and stalks.\nIf a plant creature is in the area, you can communicate with it as\nif you shared a common language, but you gain no magical ability to\ninfluence it.\nThis spell can cause the plants created by the\nentangle spell to release a\nrestrained creature.\nSpider Climb\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of bitumen and a spider)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nUntil the spell ends, one willing creature you touch gains the\nability to move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside\ndown along ceilings, while leaving its hands free. The target also\ngains a climbing speed equal to its walking speed.\nSpike Growth\n2nd-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (seven sharp thorns or seven small twigs, each sharpened to a point)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nThe ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range\ntwists and sprouts hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes\ndifficult terrain for the duration. When a creature moves into or\nwithin the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for every 5 feet it\ntravels.\nThe transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look natural. Any\ncreature that can’t see the area at the time the spell is cast must\nmake a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to\nrecognize the terrain as hazardous before entering it.\nSpirit Guardians\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot radius)\nComponents: V, S, M (a holy symbol)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a\ndistance of 15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral,\ntheir spectral form appears angelic or fey (your choice). If you are\nevil, they appear fiendish.\nWhen you cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures\nyou can see to be unaffected by it. An affected creature’s speed is\nhalved in the area, and when the creature enters the area for the\nfirst time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Wisdom\nsaving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 radiant\ndamage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage (if you\nare evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much\ndamage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 3rd.\nSpiritual Weapon\n2nd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 bonus action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 minute\nYou create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for\nthe duration or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the\nspell, you can make a melee spell attack against a creature within 5\nfeet of the weapon. On a hit, the target takes force damage equal to\n1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20\nfeet and repeat the attack against a creature within 5 feet of it.\nThe weapon can take whatever form you choose. Clerics of deities who\nare associated with a particular weapon (as St. Cuthbert is known\nfor his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell’s effect\nresemble that weapon.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two\nslot levels above 2nd.\nStinking Cloud\n3rd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 90 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a rotten egg or several skunk cabbage leaves)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas\ncentered on a point within range. The cloud spreads around corners,\nand its area is heavily obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for\nthe duration.\nEach creature that is completely within the cloud at the start of\nits turn must make a Constitution saving throw against poison. On a\nfailed save, the creature spends its action that turn retching and\nreeling. Creatures that don’t need to breathe or are immune to\npoison automatically succeed on this saving throw.\nA moderate wind (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud\nafter 4 rounds. A strong wind (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses\nit after 1 round.\nStone Shape\n4th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (soft clay, which must be worked into roughly the desired shape of the stone object)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of\nstone no more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any\nshape that suits your purpose. So, for example, you could shape a\nlarge rock into a weapon, idol, or coffer, or make a small passage\nthrough a wall, as long as the wall is less than 5 feet thick. You\ncould also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door shut.\nThe object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but\nfiner mechanical detail isn’t possible.\nStoneskin\n4th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nThis spell turns the flesh of a willing creature you touch as hard\nas stone. Until the spell ends, the target has resistance to\nnonmagical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.\nStorm of Vengeance\n9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Sight\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and\nspreading to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area,\nthunder booms, and strong winds roar. Each creature under the cloud\n(no more than 5,000 feet beneath the cloud) when it appears must\nmake a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes\n2d6 thunder damage and becomes\ndeafened for 5 minutes.\nEach round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm\nproduces additional effects on your turn.\nRound 2. Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature and\nobject under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage.\nRound 3. You call six bolts of lightning from the cloud to\nstrike six creatures or objects of your choice beneath the cloud. A\ngiven creature or object can’t be struck by more than one bolt. A\nstruck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature\ntakes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage\non a successful one.\nRound 4. Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature\nunder the cloud takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.\nRound 5–10. Gusts and freezing rain assail the area\nunder the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily\nobscured. Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon\nattacks in the area are impossible. The wind and rain count as a\nsevere distraction for the purposes of maintaining concentration on\nspells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging from 20 to 50 miles\nper hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar phenomena\nin the area, whether mundane or magical.\nSuggestion\n2nd-level enchantment\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, M (a snake’s tongue and either a bit of honeycomb or a drop of sweet oil)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 8 hours\nYou suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and\nmagically influence a creature you can see within range that can\nhear and understand you. Creatures that can’t be charmed are immune\nto this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to\nmake the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to\nstab itself, throw itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some\nother obviously harmful act ends the spell.\nThe target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, it\npursues the course of action you described to the best of its\nability. The suggested course of action can continue for the entire\nduration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter\ntime, the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to\ndo.\nYou can also specify conditions that will trigger a special activity\nduring the duration. For example, you might suggest that a knight\ngive her warhorse to the first beggar she meets. If the condition\nisn’t met before the spell expires, the activity isn’t performed. If\nyou or any of your companions damage the target, the spell ends.\nSunbeam\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (60-foot line)\nComponents: V, S, M (a magnifying glass)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a\n5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long line. Each creature in the line must make\na Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d8\nradiant damage and is blinded\nuntil your next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much\ndamage and isn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have\ndisadvantage on this saving throw.\nYou can create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn\nuntil the spell ends.\nFor the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand.\nIt sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an\nadditional 30 feet. This light is sunlight.\nSunburst\n8th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 150 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (fire and a piece of sunstone)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nBrilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point\nyou choose within range. Each creature in that light must make a\nConstitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6\nradiant damage and is blinded\nfor 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and\nisn’t blinded by this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on\nthis saving throw.\nA creature blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving\nthrow at the end of each of its turns. On a successful save, it is\nno longer blinded.\nThis spell dispels any darkness in its area that was created by a\nspell.\nSymbol\n7th-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (mercury, phosphorus, and powdered diamond and opal with a total value of at least 1,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Until dispelled or triggered\nWhen you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a\nsurface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within\nan object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a\nscroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can\ncover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If\nyou choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the\nobject is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell,\nthe glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.\nThe glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence\n(Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.\nYou decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For\nglyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include\ntouching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering\nit, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the\nobject that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the\nmost common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a\ncertain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.\nYou can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only\nunder certain circumstances or according to a creature’s physical\ncharacteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for\nexample, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You\ncan also specify creatures that don’t trigger the glyph, such as\nthose who say a certain password.\nWhen you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its\neffect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius\nsphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell\nends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is\ntargeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for\nthe first time on a turn or ends its turn there.\nDeath. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw,\ntaking 10d10 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much\ndamage on a successful save.\nDiscord. Each target must make a Constitution saving throw.\nOn a failed save, a target bickers and argues with other creatures\nfor 1 minute. During this time, it is incapable of meaningful\ncommunication and has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability\nchecks.\nFear. Each target must make a Wisdom saving throw and becomes\nfrightened for 1 minute on\na failed save. While frightened, the target drops whatever it is\nholding and must move at least 30 feet away from the glyph on each\nof its turns, if able.\nHopelessness.

    "text": "Spells: T\nSpells: T\nTelekinesis\n5th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by\nthought. When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for\nthe duration, you can exert your will on one creature or object that\nyou can see within range, causing the appropriate effect below. You\ncan affect the same target round after round, or choose a new one at\nany time. If you switch targets, the prior target is no longer\naffected by the spell.\nCreature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller creature.\nMake an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by\nthe creature’s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the\ncreature up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not\nbeyond the range of this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the\ncreature is restrained in\nyour telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in\nmid-air.\nOn subsequent rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain\nyour telekinetic grip on the creature by repeating the contest.\nObject. You can try to move an object that weighs up to 1,000\npounds. If the object isn’t being worn or carried, you automatically\nmove it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the range of\nthis spell. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must\nmake an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by\nthat creature’s Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object\naway from that creature and can move it up to 30 feet in any\ndirection but not beyond the range of this spell.\nYou can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip,\nsuch as manipulating a simple tool, opening a door or a container,\nstowing or retrieving an item from an open container, or pouring the\ncontents from a vial.\nTelepathic Bond\n5th-level divination (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (pieces of eggshell from two different kinds of creatures)\nDuration: 1 hour\nYou forge a telepathic link among up to eight willing creatures of\nyour choice within range, psychically linking each creature to all\nthe others for the duration. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 2\nor less aren’t affected by this spell.\nUntil the spell ends, the targets can communicate telepathically\nthrough the bond whether or not they have a common language. The\ncommunication is possible over any distance, though it can’t extend\nto other planes of existence.\nTeleport\n7th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nThis spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing\ncreatures of your choice that you can see within range, or a single\nobject that you can see within range, to a destination you select.\nIf you target an object, it must be able to fit entirely inside a\n10-foot cube, and it can’t be held or carried by an unwilling\ncreature.\nThe destination you choose must be known to you, and it must be on\nthe same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the\ndestination determines whether you arrive there successfully. The GM\nrolls d100 and consults the table.\nFamiliarity\nMishap\nSimilar Area\nOff Target\nOn Target\nPermanent circle\n—\n—\n—\n01–100\nAssociated object\n—\n—\n—\n01–100\nVery familiar\n01–05\n06–13\n14–24\n25–100\nSeen casually\n01–33\n34–43\n44–53\n54–100\nViewed once\n01–43\n44–53\n54–73\n74–100\nDescription\n01–43\n44–53\n54–73\n74–100\nFalse destination\n01–50\n51–100\n—\n—\nFamiliarity. Permanent circle means a permanent\nteleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. Associated\nobject means that you possess an object taken from the desired\ndestination within the last six months, such as a book from a\nwizard’s library, bed linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble\nfrom a lich’s secret tomb.\nVery familiar is a place you have been very often, a place\nyou have carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the\nspell. Seen casually is someplace you have seen more than\nonce but with which you aren’t very familiar. Viewed once is\na place you have seen once, possibly using magic. Description\nis a place whose location and appearance you know through someone\nelse’s description, perhaps from a map.\nFalse destination is a place that doesn’t exist. Perhaps you\ntried to scry an enemy’s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or\nyou are attempting to teleport to a familiar location that no longer\nexists.\nOn Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear\nwhere you want to.\nOff Target. You and your group (or the target object) appear\na random distance away from the destination in a random direction.\nDistance off target is 1d10 × 1d10 percent of the distance\nthat was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120\nmiles, landed off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then\nyou would be off target by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The GM\ndetermines the direction off target randomly by rolling a d8 and\ndesignating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so on around\nthe points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city\nand wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble.\nSimilar Area. You and your group (or the target object) wind\nup in a different area that’s visually or thematically similar to\nthe target area. If you are heading for your home laboratory, for\nexample, you might wind up in another wizard’s laboratory or in an\nalchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and\nimplements as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest\nsimilar place, but since the spell has no range limit, you could\nconceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.\nMishap. The spell’s unpredictable magic results in a\ndifficult journey. Each teleporting creature (or the target object)\ntakes 3d10 force damage, and the GM rerolls on the table to see\nwhere you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur, dealing damage each\ntime).\nTeleportation Circle\n5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, M (rare chalks and inks infused with precious gems with 50 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: 1 round\nAs you cast the spell, you draw a 10-foot-diameter circle on the\nground inscribed with sigils that link your location to a permanent\nteleportation circle of your choice whose sigil sequence you know\nand that is on the same plane of existence as you. A shimmering\nportal opens within the circle you drew and remains open until the\nend of your next turn. Any creature that enters the portal instantly\nappears within 5 feet of the destination circle or in the nearest\nunoccupied space if that space is occupied.\nMany major temples, guilds, and other important places have\npermanent teleportation circles inscribed somewhere within their\nconfines. Each such circle includes a unique sigil sequence—a\nstring of magical runes arranged in a particular pattern. When you\nfirst gain the ability to cast this spell, you learn the sigil\nsequences for two destinations on the Material Plane, determined by\nthe GM. You can learn additional sigil sequences during your\nadventures. You can commit a new sigil sequence to memory after\nstudying it for 1 minute.\nYou can create a permanent teleportation circle by casting this\nspell in the same location every day for one year. You need not use\nthe circle to teleport when you cast the spell in this way.\nThaumaturgy\nTransmutation cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Up to 1 minute\nYou manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within\nrange. You create one of the following magical effects within range:\nYour voice booms up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute.\nYou cause flames to flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1\nminute.\nYou cause harmless tremors in the ground for 1 minute.\nYou create an instantaneous sound that originates from a point of\nyour choice within range, such as a rumble of thunder, the cry of\na raven, or ominous whispers.\nYou instantaneously cause an unlocked door or window to fly open\nor slam shut.\nYou alter the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute.\nIf you cast this spell multiple times, you can have up to three of\nits 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can dismiss such an\neffect as an action.\nThunderwave\n1st-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self (15-foot cube)\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Instantaneous\nA wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a\n15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving\nthrow. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is\npushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature\ntakes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.\nIn addition, unsecured objects that are completely within the area\nof effect are automatically pushed 10 feet away from you by the\nspell’s effect, and the spell emits a thunderous boom audible out to\n300 feet.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 1st.\nTime Stop\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time\npasses for other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row,\nduring which you can use actions and move as normal.\nThis spell ends if one of the actions you use during this period, or\nany effects that you create during this period, affects a creature\nother than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other\nthan you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more\nthan 1,000 feet from the location where you cast it.\nTiny Hut\n3rd-level evocation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: Self (10-foot-radius hemisphere)\nComponents: V, S, M (a small crystal bead)\nDuration: 8 hours\nA 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence\naround and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The\nspell ends if you leave its area.\nNine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome\nwith you. The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or\nmore than nine creatures. Creatures and objects within the dome when\nyou cast this spell can move through it freely. All other creatures\nand objects are barred from passing through it. Spells and other\nmagical effects can’t extend through the dome or be cast through it.\nThe atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless\nof the weather outside.\nUntil the spell ends, you can command the interior to become dimly\nlit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you\nchoose, but it is transparent from the inside.\nTongues\n3rd-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, M (a small clay model of a ziggurat)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell grants the creature you touch the ability to understand\nany spoken language it hears. Moreover, when the target speaks, any\ncreature that knows at least one language and can hear the target\nunderstands what it says.\nTransport via Plants\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 10 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: 1 round\nThis spell creates a magical link between a Large or larger\ninanimate plant within range and another plant, at any distance, on\nthe same plane of existence. You must have seen or touched the\ndestination plant at least once before. For the duration, any\ncreature can step into the target plant and exit from the\ndestination plant by using 5 feet of movement.\nTree Stride\n5th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nYou gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to\ninside another tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees\nmust be living and at least the same size as you. You must use 5\nfeet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly know the location of\nall other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as part of the\nmove used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees\nor step out of the tree you’re in. You appear in a spot of your\nchoice within 5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet\nof movement. If you have no movement left, you appear within 5 feet\nof the tree you entered.\nYou can use this transportation ability once per round for the\nduration. You must end each turn outside a tree.\nTrue Polymorph\n9th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a drop of mercury, a dollop of gum arabic, and a wisp of smoke)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nChoose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within\nrange. You transform the creature into a different creature, the\ncreature into an object, or the object into a creature (the object\nmust be neither worn nor carried by another creature). The\ntransformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to\n0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full\nduration, the transformation lasts until it is dispelled.\nThis spell has no effect on a shapechanger or a creature with 0 hit\npoints. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if\nit succeeds, it isn’t affected by this spell.\nCreature into Creature. If you turn a creature into another\nkind of creature, the new form can be any kind you choose whose\nchallenge rating is equal to or less than the target’s (or its\nlevel, if the target doesn’t have a challenge rating). The target’s\ngame statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by\nthe statistics of the new form. It retains its alignment and\npersonality.\nThe target assumes the hit points of its new form, and when it\nreverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of\nhit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result\nof dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its\nnormal form. As long as the excess damage doesn’t reduce the\ncreature’s normal form to 0 hit points, it isn’t knocked\nunconscious.\nThe creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature\nof its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other\naction that requires hands or speech, unless its new form is capable\nof such actions.\nThe target’s gear melds into the new form. The creature can’t\nactivate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its\nequipment.\nObject into Creature. You can turn an object into any kind of\ncreature, as long as the creature’s size is no larger than the\nobject’s size and the creature’s challenge rating is 9 or lower. The\ncreature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of\nyour turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The GM\nhas the creature’s statistics and resolves all of its actions and\nmovement.\nIf the spell becomes permanent, you no longer control the creature.\nIt might remain friendly to you, depending on how you have treated\nit.\nCreature into Object. If you turn a creature into an object,\nit transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying into\nthat form. The creature’s statistics become those of the object, and\nthe creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the\nspell ends and it returns to its normal form.\nTrue Resurrection\n9th-level necromancy\nCasting Time: 1 hour\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a sprinkle of holy water and diamonds worth at least 25,000 gp, which the spell consumes)\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou touch a creature that has been dead for no longer than 200 years\nand that died for any reason except old age. If the creature’s soul\nis free and willing, the creature is restored to life with all its\nhit points.\nThis spell closes all wounds, neutralizes any poison, cures all\ndiseases, and lifts any curses affecting the creature when it died.\nThe spell replaces damaged or missing organs and limbs.\nThe spell can even provide a new body if the original no longer\nexists, in which case you must speak the creature’s name. The\ncreature then appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 10\nfeet of you.\nTrue Seeing\n6th-level divination\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (an ointment for the eyes that costs 25 gp; is made from mushroom powder, saffron, and fat; and is consumed by the spell)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell gives the willing creature you touch the ability to see\nthings as they actually are. For the duration, the creature has\ntruesight, notices secret doors hidden by magic, and can see into\nthe Ethereal Plane, all out to a range of 120 feet.\nTrue Strike\nDivination cantrip\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: S\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 round\nYou extend your hand and point a finger at a target in range. Your\nmagic grants you a brief insight into the target’s defenses. On your\nnext turn, you gain advantage on your first attack roll against the\ntarget, provided that this spell hasn’t ended."

You can\nmake the wall up to 60 feet long, 20 feet high, and 1 foot thick, or\na ringed wall up to 20 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 1 foot\nthick. The wall is opaque and lasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d8 fire\ndamage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nOne side of the wall, selected by you when you cast this spell,\ndeals 5d8 fire damage to each creature that ends its turn within 10\nfeet of that side or inside the wall. A creature takes the same\ndamage when it enters the wall for the first time on a turn or ends\nits turn there. The other side of the wall deals no damage.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 5th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot\nlevel above 4th.\nWall of Force\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a pinch of powder made by crushing a clear gemstone)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nAn invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you\nchoose within range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose,\nas a horizontal or vertical barrier or at an angle. It can be free\nfloating or resting on a solid surface. You can form it into a\nhemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or\nyou can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by-10-foot\npanels. Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any\nform, the wall is ¼ inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the\nwall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the creature\nis pushed to one side of the wall (your choice which side).\nNothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all\ndamage and can’t be dispelled by\ndispel magic. A\ndisintegrate spell\ndestroys the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the\nEthereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel through the wall.\nWall of Ice\n6th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small piece of quartz)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can\nform it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to\n10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten\n10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous with another\npanel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the\nduration.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the\ncreature within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must\nmake a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes\n10d6 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nThe wall is an object that can be damaged and thus breached. It has\nAC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable to\nfire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points\ndestroys it and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the\nwall occupied. A creature moving through the sheet of frigid air for\nthe first time on a turn must make a Constitution saving throw. That\ncreature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much\ndamage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th level or higher, the damage the wall deals when it appears\nincreases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the sheet of\nfrigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th.\nWall of Stone\n5th-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a small block of granite)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nA nonmagical wall of solid stone springs into existence at a point\nyou choose within range. The wall is 6 inches thick and is composed\nof ten 10-foot-by-10-foot panels. Each panel must be contiguous with\nat least one other panel. Alternatively, you can create\n10-foot-by-20-foot panels that are only 3 inches thick.\nIf the wall cuts through a creature’s space when it appears, the\ncreature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice). If a\ncreature would be surrounded on all sides by the wall (or the wall\nand another solid surface), that creature can make a Dexterity\nsaving throw. On a success, it can use its reaction to move up to\nits speed so that it is no longer enclosed by the wall.\nThe wall can have any shape you desire, though it can’t occupy the\nsame space as a creature or object. The wall doesn’t need to be\nvertical or rest on any firm foundation. It must, however, merge\nwith and be solidly supported by existing stone. Thus, you can use\nthis spell to bridge a chasm or create a ramp.\nIf you create a span greater than 20 feet in length, you must halve\nthe size of each panel to create supports. You can crudely shape the\nwall to create crenellations, battlements, and so on.\nThe wall is an object made of stone that can be damaged and thus\nbreached. Each panel has AC 15 and 30 hit points per inch of\nthickness. Reducing a panel to 0 hit points destroys it and might\ncause connected panels to collapse at the GM’s discretion.\nIf you maintain your concentration on this spell for its whole\nduration, the wall becomes permanent and can’t be dispelled.\nOtherwise, the wall disappears when the spell ends.\nWall of Thorns\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a handful of thorns)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 10 minutes\nYou create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with\nneedle-sharp thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid\nsurface and lasts for the duration. You choose to make the wall up\nto 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick or a circle that has\na 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet thick. The\nwall blocks line of sight.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a\nDexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 7d8\npiercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.\nA creature can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully.\nFor every 1 foot a creature moves through the wall, it must spend 4\nfeet of movement. Furthermore, the first time a creature enters the\nwall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature must make a\nDexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed\nsave, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nAt Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot\nof 7th level or higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for\neach slot level above 6th.\nWarding Bond\n2nd-level abjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Touch\nComponents: V, S, M (a pair of platinum rings worth at least 50 gp each, which you and the target must wear for the duration)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic\nconnection between you and the target until the spell ends. While\nthe target is within 60 feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and\nsaving throws, and it has resistance to all damage. Also, each time\nit takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.\nThe spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target\nbecome separated by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is\ncast again on either of the connected creatures. You can also\ndismiss the spell as an action.\nWater Breathing\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a short reed or piece of straw)\nDuration: 24 hours\nThis spell grants up to ten willing creatures you can see within\nrange the ability to breathe underwater until the spell ends.\nAffected creatures also retain their normal mode of respiration.\nWater Walk\n3rd-level transmutation (ritual)\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a piece of cork)\nDuration: 1 hour\nThis spell grants the ability to move across any liquid\nsurface—such as water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or\nlava—as if it were harmless solid ground (creatures crossing\nmolten lava can still take damage from the heat). Up to ten willing\ncreatures you can see within range gain this ability for the\nduration.\nIf you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries\nthe target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per\nround.\nWeb\n2nd-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 60 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a bit of spiderweb)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 hour\nYou conjure a mass of thick, sticky webbing at a point of your\nchoice within range. The webs fill a 20-foot cube from that point\nfor the duration. The webs are difficult terrain and lightly obscure\ntheir area.\nIf the webs aren’t anchored between two solid masses (such as walls\nor trees) or layered across a floor, wall, or ceiling, the conjured\nweb collapses on itself, and the spell ends at the start of your\nnext turn. Webs layered over a flat surface have a depth of 5 feet.\nEach creature that starts its turn in the webs or that enters them\nduring its turn must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed\nsave, the creature is\nrestrained as long as it\nremains in the webs or until it breaks free.\nA creature restrained by the webs can use its action to make a\nStrength check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it is no\nlonger restrained.\nThe webs are flammable. Any 5-foot cube of webs exposed to fire\nburns away in 1 round, dealing 2d4 fire damage to any creature that\nstarts its turn in the fire.\nWeird\n9th-level illusion\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S\nDuration: Concentration, up to one minute\nDrawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create\nillusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each\ncreature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your\nchoice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed\nsave, a creature becomes\nfrightened for the\nduration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears,\nmanifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end\nof each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a\nWisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful\nsave, the spell ends for that creature.\nWind Walk\n6th-level transmutation\nCasting Time: 1 minute\nRange: 30 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (fire and holy water)\nDuration: 8 hours\nYou and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form, a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time a creature is incapacitated and can’t move. Until the spell ends, a creature can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation.\nIf a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the\ncreature descends 60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands,\nwhich it does safely. If it can’t land after 1 minute, the creature\nfalls the remaining distance.\nWind Wall\n3rd-level evocation\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 120 feet\nComponents: V, S, M (a tiny fan and a feather of exotic origin)\nDuration: Concentration, up to 1 minute\nA wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose\nwithin range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet\nhigh, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose\nso long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall\nlasts for the duration.\nWhen the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a\nStrength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a\nfailed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nThe strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or\nsmaller flying creatures or objects can’t pass through the wall.\nLoose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward.\nArrows, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets\nbehind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss.\n(Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar\nprojectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can’t pass\nthrough it.\nWish\n9th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: Self\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nWish is the mightiest spell a mortal\ncreature can cast. By simply speaking aloud, you can alter the very\nfoundations of reality in accord with your desires.\nThe basic use of this spell is to duplicate any other spell of 8th\nlevel or lower. You don’t need to meet any requirements in that\nspell, including costly components. The spell simply takes effect.\nAlternatively, you can create one of the following effects of your\nchoice:\nYou create one object of up to 25,000 gp in value that isn’t a\nmagic item. The object can be no more than 300 feet in any\ndimension, and it appears in an unoccupied space you can see on\nthe ground.\nYou allow up to twenty creatures that you can see to regain all\nhit points, and you end all effects on them described in the\ngreater\nrestoration spell.\nYou grant up to ten creatures that you can see resistance to a\ndamage type you choose.\nYou grant up to ten creatures you can see immunity to a single\nspell or other magical effect for 8 hours. For instance, you could\nmake yourself and all your companions immune to a lich’s life\ndrain attack.\nYou undo a single recent event by forcing a reroll of any roll\nmade within the last round (including your last turn). Reality\nreshapes itself to accommodate the new result. For example, a\nwish spell could undo an opponent’s\nsuccessful save, a foe’s critical hit, or a friend’s failed save.\nYou can force the reroll to be made with advantage or\ndisadvantage, and you can choose whether to use the reroll or the\noriginal roll.\nYou might be able to achieve something beyond the scope of the above\nexamples. State your wish to the GM as precisely as possible. The GM\nhas great latitude in ruling what occurs in such an instance; the\ngreater the wish, the greater the likelihood that something goes\nwrong. This spell might simply fail, the effect you desire might\nonly be partly achieved, or you might suffer some unforeseen\nconsequence as a result of how you worded the wish. For example,\nwishing that a villain were dead might propel you forward in time to\na period when that villain is no longer alive, effectively removing\nyou from the game. Similarly, wishing for a legendary magic item or\nartifact might instantly transport you to the presence of the item’s\ncurrent owner.\nThe stress of casting this spell to produce any effect other than\nduplicating another spell weakens you. After enduring that stress,\neach time you cast a spell until you finish a long rest, you take\n1d10 necrotic damage per level of that spell. This damage can’t be\nreduced or prevented in any way. In addition, your Strength drops to\n3, if it isn’t 3 or lower already, for 2d4 days. For each of those\ndays that you spend resting and doing nothing more than light\nactivity, your remaining recovery time decreases by 2 days. Finally,\nthere is a 33 percent chance that you are unable to cast\nwish ever again if you suffer this\nstress.\nWord of Recall\n6th-level conjuration\nCasting Time: 1 action\nRange: 5 feet\nComponents: V\nDuration: Instantaneous\nYou and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly\nteleport to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures\nthat teleport with you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the\nspot you designated when you prepared your sanctuary (see below). If\nyou cast this spell without first preparing a sanctuary, the spell\nhas no effect.\nYou must designate a sanctuary by casting this spell within a\nlocation, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked to your\ndeity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area\nthat isn’t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect."

Until the spell ends, a creature that enters the spell’s area\nfor the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must make a\nCharisma saving throw. On a failed save, a creature can’t speak a\ndeliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether each creature\nsucceeds or fails on its saving throw.\nAn affected creature is aware of the spell and can thus avoid\nanswering questions to which it would normally respond with a lie.\nSuch a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as it remains\nwithin the boundaries of the truth."

    "text": "Appendix A: Conditions\nAppendix A: Conditions\nConditions alter a creature’s capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster’s attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.\nA condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.\nIf multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition’s effects don’t get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn’t.\nThe following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.\nBlinded\nA blinded creature can’t see and automatically fails any ability check that requires sight.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\nCharmed\nA charmed creature can’t attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful abilities or magical effects.\nThe charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.\nDeafened\nA deafened creature can’t hear and automatically fails any ability check that requires hearing.\nExhaustion\nSome special abilities and environmental hazards, such as starvation and the longbterm effects of freezing or scorching temperatures, can lead to a special condition called exhaustion. Exhaustion is measured in six levels. An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description.\nLevel\nEffect\n1\nDisadvantage on ability\nchecks\n2\nSpeed halved\n3\nDisadvantage on attack\nrolls and saving throws\n4\nHit point maximum halved\n5\nSpeed reduced to 0\n6\nDeath\nIf an already exhausted creature suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.\nA creature suffers the effect of its current level of exhaustion as well as all lower levels. For example, a creature suffering level 2 exhaustion has its speed halved and has disadvantage on ability checks.\nAn effect that removes exhaustion reduces its level as specified in the effect’s description, with all exhaustion effects ending if a creature’s exhaustion level is reduced below 1.\nFinishing a long rest reduces a creature’s exhaustion level by 1, provided that the creature has also ingested some food and drink.\nFrightened\nA frightened creature has disadvantage on ability checks and attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.\nThe creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.\nGrappled\nA grappled creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\nThe condition ends if the grappler is incapacitated (see the condition).\nThe condition also ends if an effect removes the grappled creature from the reach of the grappler or grappling effect, such as when a creature is hurled away by the thunderwave spell.\nIncapacitated\nAn incapacitated creature can’t take actions or reactions.\nInvisible\nAn invisible creature is impossible to see without the aid of magic or a special sense. For the purpose of hiding, the creature is heavily obscured.  The creature’s location can be detected by any noise it makes or any tracks it leaves.\nAttack rolls against the creature have disadvantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have advantage.\nParalyzed\nA paralyzed creature is incapacitated (see the condition) and can’t move or speak.\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\nAny attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.\nPetrified\nA petrified creature is transformed, along with any nonmagical object it is wearing or carrying, into a solid inanimate substance (usually stone). Its weight increases by a factor of ten, and it ceases aging.\nThe creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\nThe creature has resistance to all damage.\nThe creature is immune to poison and disease, although a poison or disease already in its system is suspended, not neutralized.\nPoisoned\nA poisoned creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks.\nProne\nA prone creature’s only movement option is to crawl, unless it stands up and thereby ends the condition.\nThe creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.\nAn attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.\nRestrained\nA restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s attack rolls have disadvantage.\nThe creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.\nStunned\nA stunned creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move, and can speak only falteringly.\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\nUnconscious\nAn unconscious creature is incapacitated (see the condition), can’t move or speak, and is unaware of its surroundings\nThe creature drops whatever it’s holding and falls prone.\nThe creature automatically fails Strength and Dexterity saving throws.\nAttack rolls against the creature have advantage.\nAny attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature."

When the first forester dared put a name to\nthe face seen in the bole of a tree or the voice babbling in a\nbrook, these gods forced themselves into being.\nThe Celtic gods are as often served by druids as by clerics, for\nthey are closely aligned with the forces of nature that druids\nrevere.\nThe Greek Pantheon\nThe gods of Olympus make themselves known with the gentle lap of\nwaves against the shores and the crash of the thunder among the\ncloud-enshrouded peaks. The thick boar-infested woods\nand the sere, olive-covered hillsides hold evidence of their\npassing.

It encompasses every world where GMs run their adventures, all within the relatively mundane realm of the Material Plane. Beyond that plane are domains of raw elemental matter and energy, realms of pure thought and ethos, the homes of demons and angels, and the dominions of the gods.\nMany spells and magic items can draw energy from these planes, summon the creatures that dwell there, communicate with their denizens, and allow adventurers to travel there. As your character achieves greater power and higher levels, you might walk on streets made of solid fire or test your mettle on a battlefield where the fallen are resurrected with each dawn."

All fantasy gaming worlds exist within the Material Plane, making it the starting point for most campaigns and adventures. The rest of the multiverse is defined in relation to the Material Plane.\nThe worlds of the Material Plane are infinitely diverse, for they reflect the creative imagination of the GMs who set their games there, as well as the players whose heroes adventure there. They include magic-wasted desert planets and island-dotted water worlds, worlds where magic combines with advanced technology and others trapped in an endless Stone Age, worlds where the gods walk and places they have abandoned."

    "text": "Beyond the Material\nBeyond the Material\nBeyond the Material Plane, the various planes of existence are realms of myth and mystery. They’re not simply other worlds, but different qualities of being, formed and governed by spiritual and elemental principles abstracted from the ordinary world.\nPlanar Travel\nWhen adventurers travel into other planes of existence, they are undertaking a legendary journey across the thresholds of existence to a mythic destination where they strive to complete their quest.  Such a journey is the stuff of legend. Braving the realms of the dead, seeking out the celestial servants of a deity, or bargaining with an efreeti in its home city will be the subject of song and story for years to come.\nTravel to the planes beyond the Material Plane can be accomplished in two ways: by casting a spell or by using a planar portal.\nSpells. A number of spells allow direct or indirect access to other planes of existence.  Plane shift and gate can transport adventurers directly to any other plane of existence, with different degrees of precision.  Etherealness allows adventurers to enter the Ethereal Plane and travel from there to any of the planes it touches—such as the Elemental Planes.  And the astral projection spell lets adventurers project themselves into the Astral Plane and travel to the Outer Planes.\nPortals. A portal is a general term for a stationary\ninterplanar connection that links a specific location on one plane\nto a specific location on another. Some portals are like doorways, a\nclear window, or a fog-shrouded passage, and simply stepping through\nit effects the interplanar travel. Others are\nlocations—circles of standing stones, soaring towers, sailing\nships, or even whole towns—that exist in multiple planes at\nonce or flicker from one plane to another in turn. Some are\nvortices, typically joining an Elemental Plane with a very similar\nlocation on the Material Plane, such as the heart of a volcano\n(leading to the Plane of Fire) or the depths of the ocean (to the\nPlane of Water).\nTransitive Planes\nThe Ethereal Plane and the Astral Plane are called the Transitive\nPlanes. They are mostly featureless realms that serve primarily as\nways to travel from one plane to another. Spells such as Etherealness and\nastral\nprojection allow characters to enter these planes and traverse\nthem to reach the planes beyond.\nThe Ethereal Plane is a misty, fog-bound dimension that is sometimes described as a great ocean. Its shores, called the Border Ethereal, overlap the Material Plane and the Inner Planes, so that every location on those planes has a corresponding location on the Ethereal Plane. Certain creatures can see into the Border Ethereal, and the see invisibility and true seeing spell grant that ability. Some magical effects also extend from the Material Plane into the Border Ethereal, particularly effects that use force energy such as forcecage and wall of force.  The depths of the plane, the Deep Ethereal, are a region of swirling mists and colorful fogs.\nThe Astral Plane is the realm of thought and dream, where\nvisitors travel as disembodied souls to reach the planes of the\ndivine and demonic. It is a great, silvery sea, the same above and\nbelow, with swirling wisps of white and gray streaking among motes\nof light resembling distant stars. Erratic whirlpools of color\nflicker in midair like spinning coins. Occasional bits of solid\nmatter can be found here, but most of the Astral Plane is an\nendless, open domain.\nInner Planes\nThe Inner Planes surround and enfold the Material Plane and its\nechoes, providing the raw elemental substance from which all the\nworlds were made. The four Elemental Planes—Air, Earth,\nFire, and Water—form a ring around the Material Plane,\nsuspended within the churning Elemental Chaos.\nAt their innermost edges, where they are closest to the Material Plane (in a conceptual if not a literal geographical sense), the\nfour Elemental Planes resemble a world in the Material Plane. The\nfour elements mingle together as they do in the Material Plane,\nforming land, sea, and sky. Farther from the Material Plane, though,\nthe Elemental Planes are both alien and hostile. Here, the elements\nexist in their purest form—great expanses of solid earth,\nblazing fire, crystal-clear water, and unsullied air. These regions\nare little-known, so when discussing the Plane of Fire, for example,\na speaker usually means just the border region.  At the farthest\nextents of the Inner Planes, the pure elements dissolve and bleed\ntogether into an unending tumult of clashing energies and colliding\nsubstance, the Elemental Chaos.\nOuter Planes\nIf the Inner Planes are the raw matter and energy that makes up the multiverse, the Outer Planes are the direction, thought and purpose for such construction. Accordingly, many sages refer to the Outer Planes as divine planes, spiritual planes, or godly planes, for the Outer Planes are best known as the homes of deities.\nWhen discussing anything to do with deities, the language used must be highly metaphorical. Their actual homes are not literally places at all, but exemplify the idea that the Outer Planes are realms of thought and spirit. As with the Elemental Planes, one can imagine the perceptible part of the Outer Planes as a sort of border region, while extensive spiritual regions lie beyond ordinary sensory experience.\nEven in those perceptible regions, appearances can be deceptive.\nInitially, many of the Outer Planes appear hospitable and familiar\nto natives of the Material Plane. But the landscape can change at\nthe whims of the powerful forces that live on the Outer Planes. The\ndesires of the mighty forces that dwell on these planes can remake\nthem completely, effectively erasing and rebuilding existence itself\nto better fulfill their own needs.\nDistance is a virtually meaningless concept on the Outer Planes. The\nperceptible regions of the planes often seem quite small, but they\ncan also stretch on to what seems like infinity. It might be\npossible to take a guided tour of the Nine Hells, from the first\nlayer to the ninth, in a single day—if the powers of the Hells\ndesire it. Or it could take weeks for travelers to make a grueling\ntrek across a single layer.\nThe most well-known Outer Planes are a group of sixteen planes that\ncorrespond to the eight alignments (excluding neutrality) and the\nshades of distinction between them.\nOuter Planes\nThe planes with some element of good in their nature are called the Upper Planes. Celestial creatures such as angels and pegasi dwell in the Upper Planes. Planes with some element of evil are the Lower Planes. Fiends such as demons and devils dwell in the Lower Planes. A plane’s alignment is its essence, and a character whose alignment doesn’t match the plane’s experiences a profound sense of dissonance there. When a good creature visits Elysium, for example (a neutral good Upper Plane), it feels in tune with the plane, but an evil creature feels out of tune and more than a little uncomfortable.\nDemiplanes\nDemiplanes are small extradimensional spaces with their own unique rules. They are pieces of reality that don’t seem to fit anywhere else. Demiplanes come into being by a variety of means. Some are created by spells, such as demiplane, or generated at the desire of a powerful deity or other force. They may exist naturally, as a fold of existing reality that has been pinched off from the rest of the multiverse, or as a baby universe growing in power. A given demiplane can be entered through a single point where it touches another plane. Theoretically, a plane shift spell can also carry travelers to a demiplane, but the proper frequency required for the tuning fork is extremely hard to acquire.  The gate spell is more reliable, assuming the caster knows of the demiplane."

    "text": "Traps\nHazards\nTraps\nTraps can be found almost anywhere. One wrong step in an ancient tomb might trigger a series of scything blades, which cleave through armor and bone. The seemingly innocuous vines that hang over a cave entrance might grasp and choke anyone who pushes through them. A net hidden among the trees might drop on travelers who pass underneath. In a fantasy game, unwary adventurers can fall to their deaths, be burned alive, or fall under a fusillade of poisoned darts.\nA trap can be either mechanical or magical in nature. Mechanical traps include pits, arrow traps, falling blocks, water-filled rooms, whirling blades, and anything else that depends on a mechanism to operate. Magic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\nTraps in Play\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\nTriggering a Trap\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.\nA trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use dispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\nTrap Effects\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.\nThe attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.\nA trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\nTrap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses\nTrap Danger\nSave DC\nAttack Bonus\nSetback\n10–11\n+3 to +5\nDangerous\n12–15\n+6 to +8\nDeadly\n16–20\n+9 to +12\nDamage Severity by Level\nCharacter Level\nSetback\nDangerous\nDeadly\n1st–4th\n1d10\n2d10\n4d10\n5th–10th\n2d10\n4d10\n10d10\n11th–16th\n4d10\n10d10\n18d10\n17th–20th\n10d10\n18d10\n24d10\nComplex Traps\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.\nWhen a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.\nFor example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\nSample Traps\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\nCollapsing Roof\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\nFalling Net\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\nFire-Breathing Statue\nMagic trap\nThis trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.\nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nWedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\nPits\nMechanical trap\nFour basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.\nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.\nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.\nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock spell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Darts\nMechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Needle\nMechanical trap\nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\nRolling Sphere\nMechanical trap\nWhen 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.\nWith a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.\nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\nSphere of Annihilation\nMagic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation that can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal sphere of annihilation.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the sympathy aspect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this enchantment."

Magic traps are either magical device traps or spell traps. Magical device traps initiate spell effects when activated. Spell traps are spells such as glyph of warding and symbol that function as traps.\nTraps in Play\nWhen adventurers come across a trap, you need to know how the trap is triggered and what it does, as well as the possibility for the characters to detect the trap and to disable or avoid it.\nTriggering a Trap\nMost traps are triggered when a creature goes somewhere or touches something that the trap’s creator wanted to protect. Common triggers include stepping on a pressure plate or a false section of floor, pulling a trip wire, turning a doorknob, and using the wrong key in a lock. Magic traps are often set to go off when a creature enters an area or touches an object. Some magic traps (such as the glyph of warding spell) have more complicated trigger conditions, including a password that prevents the trap from activating.\nDetecting and Disabling a Trap\nUsually, some element of a trap is visible to careful inspection. Characters might notice an uneven flagstone that conceals a pressure plate, spot the gleam of light off a trip wire, notice small holes in the walls from which jets of flame will erupt, or otherwise detect something that points to a trap’s presence.\nA trap’s description specifies the checks and DCs needed to detect it, disable it, or both. A character actively looking for a trap can attempt a Wisdom (Perception) check against the trap’s DC. You can also compare the DC to detect the trap with each character’s passive Wisdom (Perception) score to determine whether anyone in the party notices the trap in passing. If the adventurers detect a trap before triggering it, they might be able to disarm it, either permanently or long enough to move past it. You might call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check for a character to deduce what needs to be done, followed by a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to perform the necessary sabotage.\nAny character can attempt an Intelligence (Arcana) check to detect or disarm a magic trap, in addition to any other checks noted in the trap’s description. The DCs are the same regardless of the check used. In addition, dispel magic has a chance of disabling most magic traps. A magic trap’s description provides the DC for the ability check made when you use dispel magic.\nIn most cases, a trap’s description is clear enough that you can adjudicate whether a character’s actions locate or foil the trap. As with many situations, you shouldn’t allow die rolling to override clever play and good planning. Use your common sense, drawing on the trap’s description to determine what happens. No trap’s design can anticipate every possible action that the characters might attempt.\nYou should allow a character to discover a trap without making an ability check if an action would clearly reveal the trap’s presence. For example, if a character lifts a rug that conceals a pressure plate, the character has found the trigger and no check is required.\nFoiling traps can be a little more complicated. Consider a trapped treasure chest. If the chest is opened without first pulling on the two handles set in its sides, a mechanism inside fires a hail of poison needles toward anyone in front of it. After inspecting the chest and making a few checks, the characters are still unsure if it’s trapped. Rather than simply open the chest, they prop a shield in front of it and push the chest open at a distance with an iron rod. In this case, the trap still triggers, but the hail of needles fires harmlessly into the shield.\nTraps are often designed with mechanisms that allow them to be disarmed or bypassed. Intelligent monsters that place traps in or around their lairs need ways to get past those traps without harming themselves. Such traps might have hidden levers that disable their triggers, or a secret door might conceal a passage that goes around the trap.\nTrap Effects\nThe effects of traps can range from inconvenient to deadly, making use of elements such as arrows, spikes, blades, poison, toxic gas, blasts of fire, and deep pits. The deadliest traps combine multiple elements to kill, injure, contain, or drive off any creature unfortunate enough to trigger them. A trap’s description specifies what happens when it is triggered.\nThe attack bonus of a trap, the save DC to resist its effects, and the damage it deals can vary depending on the trap’s severity. Use the Trap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses table and the Damage Severity by Level table for suggestions based on three levels of trap severity.\nA trap intended to be a setback is unlikely to kill or seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a dangerous trap is likely to seriously injure (and potentially kill) characters of the indicated levels. A deadly trap is likely to kill characters of the indicated levels.\nTrap Save DCs and Attack Bonuses\nTrap Danger\nSave DC\nAttack Bonus\nSetback\n10–11\n+3 to +5\nDangerous\n12–15\n+6 to +8\nDeadly\n16–20\n+9 to +12\nDamage Severity by Level\nCharacter Level\nSetback\nDangerous\nDeadly\n1st–4th\n1d10\n2d10\n4d10\n5th–10th\n2d10\n4d10\n10d10\n11th–16th\n4d10\n10d10\n18d10\n17th–20th\n10d10\n18d10\n24d10\nComplex Traps\nComplex traps work like standard traps, except once activated they execute a series of actions each round. A complex trap turns the process of dealing with a trap into something more like a combat encounter.\nWhen a complex trap activates, it rolls initiative. The trap’s description includes an initiative bonus. On its turn, the trap activates again, often taking an action. It might make successive attacks against intruders, create an effect that changes over time, or otherwise produce a dynamic challenge. Otherwise, the complex trap can be detected and disabled or bypassed in the usual ways.\nFor example, a trap that causes a room to slowly flood works best as a complex trap. On the trap’s turn, the water level rises. After several rounds, the room is completely flooded.\nSample Traps\nThe magical and mechanical traps presented here vary in deadliness and are presented in alphabetical order.\nCollapsing Roof\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to collapse the supports keeping an unstable section of a ceiling in place.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two support beams. The DC to spot the trip wire is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disables the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nAnyone who inspects the beams can easily determine that they are merely wedged in place. As an action, a character can knock over a beam, causing the trap to trigger.\nThe ceiling above the trip wire is in bad repair, and anyone who can see it can tell that it’s in danger of collapse.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the unstable ceiling collapses. Any creature in the area beneath the unstable section must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Once the trap is triggered, the floor of the area is filled with rubble and becomes difficult terrain.\nFalling Net\nMechanical trap\nThis trap uses a trip wire to release a net suspended from the ceiling.\nThe trip wire is 3 inches off the ground and stretches between two columns or trees. The net is hidden by cobwebs or foliage. The DC to spot the trip wire and net is 10. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools breaks the trip wire harmlessly. A character without thieves’ tools can attempt this check with disadvantage using any edged weapon or edged tool. On a failed check, the trap triggers.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the net is released, covering a 10-foot-square area. Those in the area are trapped under the net and restrained, and those that fail a DC 10 Strength saving throw are also knocked prone. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. The net has AC 10 and 20 hit points. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) destroys a 5-foot-square section of it, freeing any creature trapped in that section.\nFire-Breathing Statue\nMagic trap\nThis trap is activated when an intruder steps on a hidden pressure plate, releasing a magical gout of flame from a nearby statue. The statue can be of anything, including a dragon or a wizard casting a spell.\nThe DC is 15 to spot the pressure plate, as well as faint scorch marks on the floor and walls. A spell or other effect that can sense the presence of magic, such as detect magic, reveals an aura of evocation magic around the statue.\nThe trap activates when more than 20 pounds of weight is placed on the pressure plate, causing the statue to release a 30-foot cone of fire. Each creature in the fire must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nWedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating. A successful dispel magic (DC 13) cast on the statue destroys the trap.\nPits\nMechanical trap\nFour basic pit traps are presented here.\nSimple Pit. A simple pit trap is a hole dug in the ground. The hole is covered by a large cloth anchored on the pit’s edge and camouflaged with dirt and debris.\nThe DC to spot the pit is 10. Anyone stepping on the cloth falls through and pulls the cloth down into the pit, taking damage based on the pit’s depth (usually 10 feet, but some pits are deeper).\nHidden Pit. This pit has a cover constructed from material identical to the floor around it.\nA successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check discerns an absence of foot traffic over the section of floor that forms the pit’s cover. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check is necessary to confirm that the trapped section of floor is actually the cover of a pit.\nWhen a creature steps on the cover, it swings open like a trapdoor, causing the intruder to spill into the pit below. The pit is usually 10 or 20 feet deep but can be deeper.\nOnce the pit trap is detected, an iron spike or similar object can be wedged between the pit’s cover and the surrounding floor in such a way as to prevent the cover from opening, thereby making it safe to cross. The cover can also be magically held shut using the arcane lock spell or similar magic.\nLocking Pit. This pit trap is identical to a hidden pit trap, with one key exception: the trap door that covers the pit is spring-loaded. After a creature falls into the pit, the cover snaps shut to trap its victim inside.\nA successful DC 20 Strength check is necessary to pry the cover open. The cover can also be smashed open. A character in the pit can also attempt to disable the spring mechanism from the inside with a DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools, provided that the mechanism can be reached and the character can see. In some cases, a mechanism (usually hidden behind a secret door nearby) opens the pit.\nSpiked Pit. This pit trap is a simple, hidden, or locking pit trap with sharpened wooden or iron spikes at the bottom. A creature falling into the pit takes 11 (2d10) piercing damage from the spikes, in addition to any falling damage. Even nastier versions have poison smeared on the spikes. In that case, anyone taking piercing damage from the spikes must also make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking an 22 (4d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Darts\nMechanical trap\nWhen a creature steps on a hidden pressure plate, poison-tipped darts shoot from spring-loaded or pressurized tubes cleverly embedded in the surrounding walls. An area might include multiple pressure plates, each one rigged to its own set of darts.\nThe tiny holes in the walls are obscured by dust and cobwebs, or cleverly hidden amid bas-reliefs, murals, or frescoes that adorn the walls. The DC to spot them is 15. With a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check, a character can deduce the presence of the pressure plate from variations in the mortar and stone used to create it, compared to the surrounding floor. Wedging an iron bonus against a random target within 10 feet of the pressure plate (vision is irrelevant to this attack roll). (If there are no targets in the area, the darts don’t hit anything.) A target that is hit takes 2 (1d4) piercing damage and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (2d10) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nPoison Needle\nMechanical trap\nA poisoned needle is hidden within a treasure chest’s lock, or in something else that a creature might open. Opening the chest without the proper key causes the needle to spring out, delivering a dose of poison.\nWhen the trap is triggered, the needle extends 3 inches straight out from the lock. A creature within range takes 1 piercing damage and 11 (2d10) poison damage, and must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned for 1 hour.\nA successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check allows a character to deduce the trap’s presence from alterations made to the lock to accommodate the needle. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves’ tools disarms the trap, removing the needle from the lock. Unsuccessfully attempting to pick the lock triggers the trap.\nRolling Sphere\nMechanical trap\nWhen 20 or more pounds of pressure are placed on this trap’s pressure plate, a hidden trapdoor in the ceiling opens, releasing a 10-foot-diameter rolling sphere of solid stone.\nWith a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check, a character can spot the trapdoor and pressure plate. A search of the floor accompanied by a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check reveals variations in the mortar and stone that betray the pressure plate’s presence. The same check made while inspecting the ceiling notes variations in the stonework that reveal the trapdoor. Wedging an iron spike or other object under the pressure plate prevents the trap from activating.\nActivation of the sphere requires all creatures present to roll initiative. The sphere rolls initiative with a +8 bonus. On its turn, it moves 60 feet in a straight line. The sphere can move through creatures’ spaces, and creatures can move through its space, treating it as difficult terrain. Whenever the sphere enters a creature’s space or a creature enters its space while it’s rolling, that creature must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 55 (10d10) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. The sphere stops when it hits a wall or similar barrier. It can’t go around corners, but smart dungeon builders incorporate gentle, curving turns into nearby passages that allow the sphere to keep moving.\nAs an action, a creature within 5 feet of the sphere can attempt to slow it down with a DC 20 Strength check. On a successful check, the sphere’s speed is reduced by 15 feet. If the sphere’s speed drops to 0, it stops moving and is no longer a threat.\nSphere of Annihilation\nMagic trap\nMagical, impenetrable darkness fills the gaping mouth of a stone face carved into a wall. The mouth is 2 feet in diameter and roughly circular. No sound issues from it, no light can illuminate the inside of it, and any matter that enters it is instantly obliterated. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check reveals that the mouth contains a sphere of annihilation that can’t be controlled or moved. It is otherwise identical to a normal sphere of annihilation.\nSome versions of the trap include an enchantment placed on the stone face, such that specified creatures feel an overwhelming urge to approach it and crawl inside its mouth. This effect is otherwise like the sympathy aspect of the antipathy/sympathy spell. A successful dispel magic (DC 18) removes this enchantment."

    "text": "Diseases\nDiseases\nA plague ravages the kingdom, setting the adventurers on a quest to find a cure. An adventurer emerges from an ancient tomb, unopened for centuries, and soon finds herself suffering from a wasting illness. A warlock offends some dark power and contracts a strange affliction that spreads whenever he casts spells.\nA simple outbreak might amount to little more than a small drain on party resources, curable by a casting of lesser restoration. A more complicated outbreak can form the basis of one or more adventures as characters search for a cure, stop the spread of the disease, and deal with the consequences.\nA disease that does more than infect a few party members is primarily a plot device. The rules help describe the effects of the disease and how it can be cured, but the specifics of how a disease works aren’t bound by a common set of rules. Diseases can affect any creature, and a given illness might or might not pass from one race or kind of creature to another. A plague might affect only constructs or undead, or sweep through a halfling neighborhood but leave other races untouched. What matters is the story you want to tell.\nSample Diseases\nThe diseases here illustrate the variety of ways disease can work in the game. Feel free to alter the saving throw DCs, incubation times, symptoms, and other characteristics of these diseases to suit your campaign.\nCackle Fever\nThis disease targets humanoids, although gnomes are strangely immune. While in the grips of this disease, victims frequently succumb to fits of mad laughter, giving the disease its common name and its morbid nickname: the shrieks.\nSymptoms manifest 1d4 hours after infection and include fever and disorientation. The infected creature gains one level of exhaustion that can’t be removed until the disease is cured.\nAny event that causes the infected creature great stress—including entering combat, taking damage, experiencing fear, or having a nightmare—forces the creature to make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 5 (1d10) psychic damage and becomes incapacitated with mad laughter for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending\nthe mad laughter and the incapacitated condition on a success.\nAny humanoid creature that starts its turn within 10 feet of an infected creature in the throes of mad laughter must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or also become infected with the disease. Once a creature succeeds on this save, it is immune to the mad laughter of that particular infected creature for 24 hours.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature can make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, the DC for this save and for the save to avoid an attack of mad laughter drops by 1d6. When the saving throw DC drops to 0, the creature recovers from the disease. A creature that fails three of these saving throws gains a randomly determined form of indefinite madness, as described later in this chapter.\nSewer Plague\nSewer plague is a generic term for a broad category of illnesses that incubate in sewers, refuse heaps, and stagnant swamps, and which are sometimes transmitted by creatures that dwell in those areas, such as rats and otyughs.\nWhen a humanoid creature is bitten by a creature that carries the disease, or when it comes into contact with filth or offal contaminated by the disease, the creature must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution saving throw or become infected.\nIt takes 1d4 days for sewer plague’s symptoms to manifest in an infected creature. Symptoms include fatigue and cramps. The infected creature suffers one level of exhaustion, and it regains only half the normal number of hit points from spending Hit Dice and no hit points from finishing a long rest.\nAt the end of each long rest, an infected creature must make a DC 11 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the character gains one level of exhaustion. On a successful save, the character’s exhaustion level decreases by one level. If a successful saving throw reduces the infected creature’s level of exhaustion below 1, the creature recovers from the disease.\nSight Rot\nThis painful infection causes bleeding from the eyes and eventually blinds the victim.\nA beast or humanoid that drinks water tainted by sight rot must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become infected. One day after infection, the creature’s vision starts to become blurry. The creature takes a −1 penalty to attack rolls and ability checks that rely on sight. At the end of each long rest after the symptoms appear, the penalty worsens by 1. When it reaches −5, the victim is blinded until its sight is restored by magic such as lesser restoration or heal.\nSight rot can be cured using a rare flower called Eyebright, which grows in some swamps. Given an hour, a character who has proficiency with an herbalism kit can turn the flower into one dose of ointment. Applied to the eyes before a long rest, one dose of it prevents the disease from worsening after that rest. After three doses, the ointment cures the disease entirely."

    "text": "Madness\nMadness\nIn a typical campaign, characters aren’t driven mad by the horrors they face and the carnage they inflict day after day, but sometimes the stress of being an adventurer can be too much to bear. If your campaign has a strong horror theme, you might want to use madness as a way to reinforce that theme, emphasizing the extraordinarily horrific nature of the threats the adventurers face.\nGoing Mad\nVarious magical effects can inflict madness on an otherwise stable mind. Certain spells, such as contact other plane and symbol, can cause insanity, and you can use the madness rules here instead of the spell effects of those spells. Diseases, poisons, and planar effects such as psychic wind or the howling winds of Pandemonium can all inflict madness. Some artifacts can also break the psyche of a character who uses or becomes attuned to them.\nResisting a madness-inducing effect usually requires a Wisdom or Charisma saving throw.\nMadness Effects\nMadness can be short-term, long-term, or indefinite. Most relatively mundane effects impose short-term madness, which lasts for just a few minutes. More horrific effects or cumulative effects can result in long-term or indefinite madness.\nA character afflicted with short-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Short-Term Madness table for 1d10 minutes.\nA character afflicted with long-term madness is subjected to an effect from the Long-Term Madness table for 1d10 × 10 hours.\nA character afflicted with indefinite madness gains a new character flaw from the Indefinite Madness table that lasts until cured.\nShort-Term Madness\nd100\nEffect (lasts 1d10 minutes)\n01–20\nThe character retreats into his or her mind and becomes paralyzed. The effect ends if the character takes any damage.\n21–30\nThe character becomes incapacitated and spends the duration screaming, laughing, or weeping.\n31–40\nThe character becomes frightened and must use his or her action and movement each round to flee from the source of the fear.\n41–50\nThe character begins babbling and is incapable of normal speech or spellcasting.\n51–60\nThe character must use his or her action each round to attack the nearest creature.\n61–70\nThe character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n71–75\nThe character does whatever anyone tells him or her to do that isn’t obviously self-destructive.\n76–80\nThe character experiences an overpowering urge to eat something strange such as dirt, slime, or offal.\n81–90\nThe character is stunned.\n91–100\nThe character falls unconscious.\nLong-Term Madness\nd100\nEffect (lasts 1d10 × 10 hours)\n01–10\nThe character feels compelled to repeat a specific activity over and over, such as washing hands, touching things, praying, or counting coins.\n11–20\nThe character experiences vivid hallucinations and has disadvantage on ability checks.\n21–30\nThe character suffers extreme paranoia. The character has disadvantage on Wisdom and Charisma checks.\n31–40\nThe character regards something (usually the source of madness) with intense revulsion, as if affected by the antipathy effect of the antipathy/sympathy spell.\n41–45\nThe character experiences a powerful delusion. Choose a potion. The character imagines that he or she is under its effects.\n46–55\nThe character becomes attached to a lucky charm, such as a person or an object, and has disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws while more than 30 feet from it.\n56–65\nThe character is blinded (25%) or deafened (75%).\n66–75\nThe character experiences uncontrollable tremors or tics, which impose disadvantage on attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws that involve Strength or Dexterity.\n76–85\nThe character suffers from partial amnesia. The character knows who he or she is and retains racial traits and class features, but doesn’t recognize other people or remember anything that happened before the madness took effect.\n86–90\nWhenever the character takes damage, he or she must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as though he or she failed a saving throw against the confusion spell. The confusion effect lasts for 1 minute.\n91–95\nThe character loses the ability to speak.\n96–100\nThe character falls unconscious. No amount of jostling or damage can wake the character.\nIndefinite Madness\nd100\nFlaw (lasts until cured)\n01–15\nBeing drunk keeps me sane.\n16–25\nI keep whatever I find.\n26–30\nI try to become more like someone else I know—adopting his or her style of dress, mannerisms, and name.\n36–45\nAchieving my goal is the only thing of interest to me, and I’ll ignore everything else to pursue it.\n51–55\nI don’t like the way people judge me all the time.\n71–80\nI am convinced that powerful enemies are hunting me, and their agents are everywhere I go. I am sure they’re watching me all the time.\n86–95\nI can’t take anything seriously. The more serious the situation, the funnier I find it.\n31–35\nI must bend the truth, exaggerate, or outright lie to be interesting to other people.\n46–50\nI find it hard to care about anything that goes on around me.\n56–70\nI am the smartest, wisest, strongest, fastest, and most beautiful person I know.\n81–85\nThere’s only one person I can trust. And only I can see this special friend.\n96–100\nI’ve discovered that I really like killing people.\nCuring Madness\nA calm emotions spell can suppress the effects of madness, while a lesser restoration spell can rid a character of a short-term or long-term madness. Depending on the source of the madness, remove curse or dispel evil might also prove effective. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is required to rid a character of indefinite madness."

    "text": "Objects\nObjects\nWhen characters need to saw through ropes, shatter a window, or smash a vampire’s coffin, the only hard and fast rule is this: given enough time and the right tools, characters can destroy any destructible object. Use common sense when determining a character’s success at damaging an object. Can a fighter cut through a section of a stone wall with a sword? No, the sword is likely to break before the wall does.\nFor the purpose of these rules, an object is a discrete, inanimate item like a window, door, sword, book, table, chair, or stone, not a building or a vehicle that is composed of many other objects.\nStatistics for Objects\nWhen time is a factor, you can assign an Armor Class and hit points to a destructible object. You can also give it immunities, resistances, and vulnerabilities to specific types of damage.\nArmor Class. An object’s Armor Class is a measure of how difficult it is to deal damage to the object when striking it (because the object has no chance of dodging out of the way). The Object Armor Class table provides suggested AC values for various substances.\nObject Armor Class\nSubstance\nAC\nCloth, paper, rope\n11\nCrystal, glass, ice\n13\nWood, bone\n15\nStone\n17\nIron, steel\n19\nMithral\n21\nAdamantine\n23\nHit Points. An object’s hit points measure how much damage it can take before losing its structural integrity. Resilient objects have more hit points than fragile ones. Large objects also tend to have more hit points than small ones, unless breaking a small part of the object is just as effective as breaking the whole thing. The Object Hit Points table provides suggested hit points for fragile and resilient objects that are Large or smaller.\nObject Hit Points\nSize\nFragile\nResilient\nTiny (bottle, lock)\n2 (1d4)\n5 (2d4)\nSmall (chest, lute)\n3 (1d6)\n10 (3d6)\nMedium (barrel, chandelier)\n4 (1d8)\n18 (4d8)\nLarge (cart, 10-ft.-by-10-ft. window)\n5 (1d10)\n27 (5d10)\nHuge and Gargantuan Objects. Normal weapons are of little use against many Huge and Gargantuan objects, such as a colossal statue, towering column of stone, or massive boulder. That said, one torch can burn a Huge tapestry, and an earthquake spell can reduce a colossus to rubble. You can track a Huge or Gargantuan object’s hit points if you like, or you can simply decide how long the object can withstand whatever weapon or force is acting against it. If you track hit points for the object, divide it into Large or smaller sections, and track each section’s hit points separately. Destroying one of those sections could ruin the entire object. For example, a Gargantuan statue of a human might topple over when one of its Large legs is reduced to 0 hit points.\nObjects and Damage Types. Objects are immune to poison and psychic damage. You might decide that some damage types are more effective against a particular object or substance than others. For example, bludgeoning damage works well for smashing things but not for cutting through rope or leather. Paper or cloth objects might be vulnerable to fire and lightning damage. A pick can chip away stone but can’t effectively cut down a tree. As always, use your best judgment.\nDamage Threshold. Big objects such as castle walls often have extra resilience represented by a damage threshold. An object with a damage threshold has immunity to all damage unless it takes an amount of damage from a single attack or effect equal to or greater than its damage threshold, in which case it takes damage as normal. Any damage that fails to meet or exceed the object’s damage threshold is considered superficial and doesn’t reduce the object’s hit points."

    "text": "Poisons\nPoisons\nGiven their insidious and deadly nature, poisons are illegal in most societies but are a favorite tool among assassins, drow, and other evil creatures.\nPoisons come in the following four types.\nContact. Contact poison can be smeared on an object and remains potent until it is touched or washed off. A creature that touches contact poison with exposed skin suffers its effects.\nIngested. A creature must swallow an entire dose of ingested poison to suffer its effects. The dose can be delivered in food or a liquid. You may decide that a partial dose has a reduced effect, such as allowing advantage on the saving throw or dealing only half damage on a failed save.\nInhaled. These poisons are powders or gases that take effect when inhaled. Blowing the powder or releasing the gas subjects creatures in a 5-foot cube to its effect. The resulting cloud dissipates immediately afterward. Holding one’s breath is ineffective against inhaled poisons, as they affect nasal membranes, tear ducts, and other parts of the body.\nInjury. Injury poison can be applied to weapons, ammunition, trap components, and other objects that deal piercing or slashing damage and remains potent until delivered through a wound or washed off.

    "text": "Magic Items\nTreasure\nMagic Items\nMagic items are presented in alphabetical order. A magic item’s description gives the item’s name, its category, its rarity, and its magical properties.\nAdamantine Armor\nArmor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon\nThis suit of armor is reinforced with adamantine, one of the hardest substances in existence. While you’re wearing it, any critical hit against you becomes a normal hit.\nAmmunition, +1, +2, or +3\nWeapon (any ammunition), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)\nYou have a bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this piece of magic ammunition. The bonus is determined by the rarity of the ammunition. Once it hits a target, the ammunition is no longer magical.\nAmulet of Health\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYour Constitution score is 19 while you wear this amulet. It has no effect on you if your Constitution is already 19 or higher.\nAmulet of Proof against Detection and Location\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this amulet, you are hidden from divination magic. You can’t be targeted by such magic or perceived through magical scrying sensors.\nAmulet of the Planes\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this amulet, you can use an action to name a location that you are familiar with on another plane of existence. Then make a DC 15 Intelligence check. On a successful check, you cast the plane shift spell. On a failure, you and each creature and object within 15 feet of you travel to a random destination. Roll a d100. On a 1–60, you travel to a random location on the plane you named. On a 61–100, you travel to a randomly determined plane of existence.\nAnimated Shield\nArmor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you can speak its command word as a bonus action to cause it to animate. The shield leaps into the air and hovers in your space to protect you as if you were wielding it, leaving your hands free. The shield remains animated for 1 minute, until you use a bonus action to end this effect, or until you are incapacitated or die, at which point the shield falls to the ground or into your hand if you have one free.\nApparatus of the Crab\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis item first appears to be a Large sealed iron barrel weighing 500 pounds. The barrel has a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 20 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch at one end of the barrel, allowing two Medium or smaller creatures to crawl inside. Ten levers are set in a row at the far end, each in a neutral position, able to move either up or down. When certain levers are used, the apparatus transforms to resemble a giant lobster.\nThe apparatus of the Crab is a Large object with the following statistics:\nArmor Class: 20\nHit Points: 200\nSpeed: 30 ft., swim 30 ft. (or 0 ft. for both if the legs and tail aren’t extended)\nDamage Immunities: poison, psychic\nTo be used as a vehicle, the apparatus requires one pilot. While the apparatus’s hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight. The compartment holds enough air for 10 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside.\nThe apparatus floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 900 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\nA creature in the compartment can use an action to move as many as two of the apparatus’s levers up or down. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position. Each lever, from left to right, functions as shown in the Apparatus of the Crab Levers table.\nApparatus of the Crab Levers\nLever\nUp\nDown\n1\nLegs and tail extend, allawing the apparatus to walk and swim.\nLegs and tail retract, reducing the apparatus’s speed to 0 and making it unable to benefit from bonuses to speed.\n2\nForward window shutter opens.\nForward window shutter closes.\n3\nSide window shutters open (two per side).\nSide window shutters close (two per side).\n4\nTwo claws extend from the front sides of the apparatus.\nThe claws retract.\n5\nEach extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 7 (2d6) bludgeoning damage.\nEach extended claw makes the following melee weapon attack: +8 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: the target is grappled (escape DC 15).\n6\nThe apparatus walks or swims forward.\nThe apparatus walks or swims backward.\n7\nThe apparatus turns 90 degrees left.\nThe apparatus turns 90 degrees right.\n8\nEyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.\nThe light turns off.\n9\nThe apparatus sinks as much as 20 feet in liquid.\nThe apparatus rises up to 20 feet in liquid.\n10\nThe rear hatch unseals and opens.\nThe rear hatch closes and seals.\nArmor, +1, +2, or +3\nArmor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (+1), very rare (+2), or legendary (+3)\nYou have a bonus to AC while wearing this armor. The bonus is determined by its rarity.\nArmor of Invulnerability\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nArmor of Resistance\nArmor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.\nd10\nDamage Type\n1\nAcid\n2\nCold\n3\nFire\n4\nForce\n5\nLightning\n6\nNecrotic\n7\nPoison\n8\nPsychic\n9\nRadiant\n10\nThunder\nArmor of Vulnerability\nArmor (plate), rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.\nCurse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).\nArrow-Catching Shield\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.\nArrow of Slaying\nWeapon (arrow), very rare\nAn arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\nOnce an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.\nOther types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.\nBag of Beans\nWondrous item, rare\nInside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs ½ pound plus ¼ pound for each bean it contains.\nIf you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.\nIf you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.\nd100\nEffect\n01\n5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.\n02–10\nA geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.\n11–20\nA treant sprouts. There’s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks.\n21–30\nAn animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.\n31–40\nA campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished).\n41–50\n1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout\n51–60\n1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke.\n61–70\nA hungry bulette burrows up and attacks.\n71–80\nA fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM’s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.\n81–90\nA nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion.\n91–99\nA pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord’s lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM’s choice.\n00\nA giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM’s choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant’s castle, or a different plane of existence.\nBag of Devouring\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.\nThe extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.\nInanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.\nBag of Holding\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.\nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\nPlacing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\nBag of Tricks\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs ½ pound.\nYou can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.\nOnce three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nGray Bag of Tricks\nd8\nCreature\n1\nWeasel\n2\nGiant rat\n3\nBadger\n4\nBoar\n5\nPanther\n6\nGiant badger\n7\nDire wolf\n8\nGiant elk\nRust Bag of Tricks\nd8\nCreature\n1\nRat\n2\nOwl\n3\nMastiff\n4\nGoat\n5\nGiant goat\n6\nGiant boar\n7\nLion\n8\nBrown bear\nTan Bag of Tricks\nd8\nCreature\n1\nJackal\n2\nApe\n3\nBaboon\n4\nAxe beak\n5\nBlack bear\n6\nGiant weasel\n7\nGiant hyena\n8\nTiger\nBead of Force\nWondrous item, rare\nThis small black sphere measures ¾ of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads of force are found together.\nYou can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.\nAn enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.\nBelt of Dwarvenkind\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:\nYour Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.\nYou have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.\nIn addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you’re capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.\nIf you aren’t a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:\nYou have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\nYou have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\nYou can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.\nBelt of Giant Strength\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt’s score, the item has no effect on you.\nSix varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant strength look different, but they have the same effect.\nType\nStrength\nRarity\nHill giant\n21\nRare\nStone/frost giant\n23\nVery rare\nFire giant\n25\nVery rare\nCloud giant\n27\nLegendary\nStorm giant\n29\nLegendary\nBerserker Axe\nWeapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.\nCurse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nWhenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nBoots of Elvenkind\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.\nBoots of Levitation\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use an action to cast the levitate spell on yourself at will.\nBoots of Speed\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots’ heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.\nWhen the boots’ property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.\nBoots of Striding and Springing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.\nBoots of the Winterlands\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese furred boots are snug and feel quite warm.

It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.\nYou can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.\nCandle of Invocation\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s alignment. The candle’s alignment can be detected with the detect evil and good spell.

After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle’s total burn time.\nWhile lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle’s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.\nCape of the Mountebank\nWondrous item, rare\nThis cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the dimension door spell as an action. This property of the cape can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nWhen you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.\nCarpet of Flying\nWondrous item, very rare\nYou can speak the carpet’s command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.\nFour sizes of carpet of flying exist.

It weighs 1 pound.\nChime of Opening\nWondrous item, rare\nThis hollow metal tube measures about 1 foot long and weighs 1 pound. You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can’t reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens. The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.\nCirclet of Blasting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the scorching ray spell with it.

The web created by the spell fills twice its normal area. Once used, this property of the cloak can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nCloak of Displacement\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this cloak, it projects an illusion that makes you appear to be standing in a place near your actual location, causing any creature to have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. If you take damage, the property ceases to function until the start of your next turn. This property is suppressed while you are incapacitated, restrained, or otherwise unable to move.\nCloak of Elvenkind\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this cloak with its hood up, Wisdom (Perception) checks made to see you have disadvantage, and you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide, as the cloak’s color shifts to camouflage you. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.\nCloak of Protection\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws while you wear this cloak.\nCloak of the Bat\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this cloak, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. In an area of dim light or darkness, you can grip the edges of the cloak with both hands and use it to fly at a speed of 40 feet. If you ever fail to grip the cloak’s edges while flying in this way, or if you are no longer in dim light or darkness, you lose this flying speed.\nWhile wearing the cloak in an area of dim light or darkness, you can use your action to cast polymorph on yourself, transforming into a bat. While you are in the form of the bat, you retain your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. The cloak can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.\nCloak of the Manta Ray\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this cloak with its hood up, you can breathe underwater, and you have a swimming speed of 60 feet. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.\nCrystal Ball\nWondrous item, very rare or legendary (requires attunement)\nThe typical crystal ball, a very rare item, is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the scrying spell (save DC 17) with it.\nThe following crystal ball variants are legendary items and have additional properties.\nCrystal Ball of Mind Reading. You can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 17) while you are scrying with the crystal ball, targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You don’t need to concentrate on this detect thoughts to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends.\nCrystal Ball of Telepathy. While scrying with the crystal ball, you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell’s sensor. You can also use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don’t need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if scrying ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the crystal ball can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nCrystal Ball of True Seeing. While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s sensor.\nCube of Force\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.\nYou can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.\nIf your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.\nCube of Force Faces\nFace\nCharges\nEffect\n1\n1\nGases, wind, and fog can’t pass through the barrier.\n2\n2\nNonliving matter can’t pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.\n3\n3\nLiving matter can’t pass through the barrier.\n4\n4\nSpell effects can’t pass through the barrier.\n5\n5\nNothing can pass through the barrier. Walls, floors, and ceilings can pass through at your discretion.\n6\n0\nThe barrier deactivates.\nThe cube loses charges when the barrier is targeted by certain spells or comes into contact with certain spell or magic item effects, as shown in the table below.\nSpell or Item\nCharges Lost\nDisintegrate\n1d12\nHorn of blasting\n1d10\nPasswall\n1d6\nPrismatic spray\n1d20\nWall of fire\n1d4\nCubic Gate\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis cube is 3 inches across and radiates palpable magical energy. The six sides of the cube are each keyed to a different plane of existence, one of which is the Material Plane. The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.\nYou can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.\nThe cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nDagger of Venom\nWeapon (dagger), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nYou can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.\nDancing Sword\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.\nWhile the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\nAfter the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.\nDecanter of Endless Water\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.\nYou can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:\nStream produces 1 gallon of water.\nFountain produces 5 gallons of water.\nGeyser produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn’t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.\nDeck of Illusions\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again.\nPlaying Card\nIllusion\nAce of hearts\nRed dragon\nKing of hearts\nKnight and four guards\nQueen of hearts\nSuccubus or incubus\nJack of hearts\nDruid\nTen of hearts\nCloud giant\nNine of hearts\nEttin\nEight of hearts\nBugbear\nTwo of hearts\nGoblin\nAce of diamonds\nTrademarked eyebeast\nKing of diamonds\nArchmage and mage apprentice\nQueen of diamonds\nNight hag\nJack of diamonds\nAssassin\nTen of diamonds\nFire giant\nNine of diamonds\nOgre mage\nEight of diamonds\nGnoll\nTwo of diamonds\nKobold\nAce of spades\nLich\nKing of spades\nPriest and two acolytes\nQueen of spades\nMedusa\nJack of spades\nVeteran\nTen of spades\nFrost giant\nNine of spades\nTroll\nEight of spades\nHobgoblin\nTwo of spades\nGoblin\nAce of clubs\nIron golem\nKing of clubs\nBandit captain and three bandits\nQueen of clubs\nErinyes\nJack of clubs\nBerserker\nTen of clubs\nHill giant\nNine of clubs\nOgre\nEight of clubs\nOrc\nTwo of clubs\nKobold\nJokers (2)\nYou (the deck’s owner)\nDeck of Many Things\nWondrous item, legendary\nUsually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\nPlaying Card\nCard\nAce of diamonds\nVizier*\nKing of diamonds\nSun\nQueen of diamonds\nMoon\nJack of diamonds\nStar\nTwo of diamonds\nComet*\nAce of hearts\nThe Fates*\nKing of hearts\nThrone\nQueen of hearts\nKey\nJack of hearts\nKnight\nTwo of hearts\nGem*\nAce of clubs\nTalons*\nKing of clubs\nThe Void\nQueen of clubs\nFlames\nJack of clubs\nSkull\nTwo of clubs\nIdiot*\nAce of spades\nDonjon*\nKing of spades\nRuin\nQueen of spades\nEuryale\nJack of spades\nRogue\nTwo of spades\nBalance*\nJoker (with TM)\nFool*\nJoker (without TM)\nJester\n*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\nBalance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\nComet. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\nDonjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\nEuryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\nThe Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\nFlames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\nFool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\nGem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\nIdiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\nJester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\nKey. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\nKnight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\nMoon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\nRogue. A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.\nRuin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\nSkull. You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.\nAvatar of Death\nMedium undead, neutral evil\nArmor Class 20\nHit Points half the hit point maximum of its summoner\nSpeed 60 ft., fly 60 ft. (hover)\nSTR\nDEX\nCON\nINT\nWIS\nCHA\n16 (+3)\n16 (+3)\n16 (+3)\n16 (+3)\n16 (+3)\n16 (+3)\nDamage Immunities necrotic, poison\nCondition Immunities charmed, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, poisoned, unconscious\nSenses darkvision 60 ft., truesight 60 ft., passive Perception 13\nLanguages all languages known to its summoner\nChallenge — (0 XP)\nIncorporeal Movement. The avatar can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. It takes 5 (1d10) force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.\nTurning Immunity. The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.\nActions\nReaping Scythe. The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.\nStar. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.\nSun. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\nTalons. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish.\nThrone. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nVizier. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nThe Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\nDefender\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\nDemon Armor\nArmor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.\nCurse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.\nDimensional Shackles\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.\nYou and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.\nDragon Scale Mail\nArmor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)\nDragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).\nAdditionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nDragon\nResistance\nBlack\nAcid\nBlue\nLightning\nBrass\nFire\nBronze\nLightning\nCopper\nAcid\nGold\nFire\nGreen\nPoison\nRed\nFire\nSilver\nCold\nWhite\nCold\nDragon Slayer\nWeapon (any sword), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nWhen you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon’s type. For the purpose of this weapon, dragon refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.\nDust of Disappearance\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.\nDust of Dryness\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nDust of Sneezing and Choking\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.\nDwarven Plate\nArmor (plate), very rare\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.\nDwarven Thrower\nWeapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.\nEfficient Quiver\nWondrous item, uncommon\nEach of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.\nYou can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\nEfreeti Bottle\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\nThe first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nd100\nEffect\n01–10\nThe efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.\n11–90\nThe efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.\n91–00\nThe efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.\nElemental Gem\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nGem\nSummoned Elemental\nBlue sapphire\nAir elemental\nYellow diamond\nEarth elemental\nRed corundum\nFire elemental\nEmerald\nWater elemental\nElven Chain\nArmor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\nEversmoking Bottle\nWondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\nEyes of Charming\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.\nEyes of Minute Seeing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.\nEyes of the Eagle\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.\nFeather Token\nWondrous item, rare\nThis tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.\nd100\nFeather Token\n01–20\nAnchor\n21–35\nBird\n36–50\nFan\n51–65\nSwan boat\n66–90\nTree\n91–00\nWhip\nAnchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\nBird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\nFan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.\nSwan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.\nTree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\nWhip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.\nFigurine of Wondrous Power\nWondrous item, rarity by figurine\nA figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.\nBronze Griffon (Rare).

Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.\nThe goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s aura for the next 24 hours.

These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.\nFolding Boat\nWondrous item, rare\nThis object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside.

The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.\nThe second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep.

The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.\nWhen the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.\nThe third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard.

They have no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher.\nGem of Brightness\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\nThe first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.\nThe second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.\nWhen all of the gem’s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.\nGem of Seeing\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis gem has 3 charges.

The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you’re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.\nGloves of Swimming and Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don’t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.\nGoggles of Night\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.\nHammer of Thunderbolts\nWeapon (maul), legendary\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nGiant’s Bane (Requires Attunement). You must be wearing a belt of giant strength (any variety) and gauntlets of ogre power to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.\nThe hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.\nHandy Haversack\nWondrous item, rare\nThis backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\nHat of Disguise\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.\nHeadband of Intellect\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYour Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this headband.

Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.\nYou gain the following benefits while wearing it:\nYou can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a component: daylight (opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray (diamond), or wall of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\nAs long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.\nAs long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.\nAs long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.\nRoll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.\nHelm of Comprehending Languages\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the comprehend languages spell from it at will.\nHelm of Telepathy\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.\nWhile focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nHelm of Teleportation\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the teleport spell from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nHoly Avenger\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.\nWhile you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.\nHorn of Blasting\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.\nEach use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\nHorn of Valhalla\nWondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)\nYou can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nFour types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.\nd100\nHorn Type\nBerserkers Summoned\nRequirement\n01–40\nSilver\n2d4 + 2\nNone\n41–75\nBrass\n3d4 + 3\nProficiency with all simple weapons\n76–90\nBronze\n4d4 + 4\nProficiency with all medium armor\n91–00\nIron\n5d4 + 5\nProficiency with all martial weapons\nIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.\nHorseshoes of a Zephyr\nWondrous item, very rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\nHorseshoes of Speed\nWondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature’s walking speed by 30 feet.\nImmovable Rod\nRod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\nInstant Fortress\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\nThe tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\nIoun Stone\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nAn Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.\nWhen you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.\nA stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\nAwareness (Rare). You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nFortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\nGreater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nInsight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.\nIntellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head. Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head. Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.\nProtection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.\nRegeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare). You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\nIron Bands of Binding\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.\nMake a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.\nA creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.\nOnce the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nIron Flask\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.\nYou can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.\nAn identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nd100\nContents\n1–50\nEmpty\n51–54\nDemon (type 1)\n55–58\nDemon (type 2)\n59–62\nDemon (type 3)\n63–64\nDemon (type 4)\n65\nDemon (type 5)\n66\nDemon (type 6)\n67\nDeva\n68–69\nDevil (greater)\n70–73\nDevil (lesser)\n74–75\nDjinni\n76–77\nEfreeti\n78–83\nElemental (any)\n84–86\nInvisible stalker\n87–90\nNight hag\n91\nPlanetar\n92–95\nSalamander\n96\nSolar\n97–99\nSuccubus/incubus\n100\nXorn\nJavelin of Lightning\nWeapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.\nThe javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.\nLantern of Revealing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet.

Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMantle of Spell Resistance\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.\nManual of Bodily Health\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nManual of Gainful Exercise\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nManual of Golems\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can’t use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\nd20\nGolem\nTime\nCost\n1–5\nClay\n30 days\n65,000 gp\n6–17\nFlesh\n60 days\n50,000 gp\n18\nIron\n120 days\n100,000 gp\n19–20\nStone\n90 days\n80,000 gp\nTo create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.\nOnce you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.\nManual of Quickness of Action\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nMarvelous Pigments\nWondrous item, very rare\nTypically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons— that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\nMedallion of Thoughts\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMirror of Life Trapping\nWondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\nMithral Armor\nArmor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon\nMithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.\nNecklace of Adaptation\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\nNecklace of Fireballs\nWondrous item, rare\nThis necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\nNecklace of Prayer Beads\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)\nThis necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.\nSix types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nd20\nBead of …\nSpell\n1–6\nBlessing\nBless\n7–12\nCuring\nCure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration\n13–16\nFavor\nGreater restoration\n17–18\nSmiting\nBranding smite\n19\nSummons\nPlanar ally\n20\nWind walking\nWind walk\nNine Lives Stealer\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\nOathbow\nWeapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, Swift defeat to my enemies. When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, Swift death to you who have wronged me. The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.\nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.\nOil of Etherealness\nPotion, rare\nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\nOil of Sharpness\nPotion, very rare\nThis clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\nOil of Slipperiness\nPotion, uncommon\nThis sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.\nAlternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\nPearl of Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)\nWhile this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot. If the expended slot was of 4th level or higher, the new slot is 3rd level. Once you use the pearl, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nPeriapt of Health\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou are immune to contracting any disease while you wear this pendant. If you are already infected with a disease, the effects of the disease are suppressed you while you wear the pendant.\nPeriapt of Proof against Poison\nWondrous item, rare\nThis delicate silver chain has a brilliant-cut black gem pendant. While you wear it, poisons have no effect on you. You are immune to the poisoned condition and have immunity to poison damage.\nPeriapt of Wound Closure\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear this pendant, you stabilize whenever you are dying at the start of your turn. In addition, whenever you roll a Hit Die to regain hit points, double the number of hit points it restores.\nPhilter of Love\nPotion, uncommon\nThe next time you see a creature within 10 minutes after drinking this philter, you become charmed by that creature for 1 hour. If the creature is of a species and gender you are normally attracted to, you regard it as your true love while you are charmed. This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\nPipes of Haunting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nWhenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nPortable Hole\nWondrous item, rare\nThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\nYou can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\nPotion of Animal Friendship\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will. Agitating this muddy liquid brings little bits into view: a fish scale, a hummingbird tongue, a cat claw, or a squirrel hair.\nPotion of Clairvoyance\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the clairvoyance spell. An eyeball bobs in this yellowish liquid but vanishes when the potion is opened.\nPotion of Climbing\nPotion, common\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain a climbing speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour. During this time, you have advantage on Strength (Athletics) checks you make to climb. The potion is separated into brown, silver, and gray layers resembling bands of stone. Shaking the bottle fails to mix the colors.\nPotion of Diminution\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the reduce effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously contracts to a tiny bead and then expands to color the clear liquid around it. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\nPotion of Flying\nPotion, very rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain a flying speed equal to your walking speed for 1 hour and can hover. If you’re in the air when the potion wears off, you fall unless you have some other means of staying aloft. This potion’s clear liquid floats at the top of its container and has cloudy white impurities drifting in it.\nPotion of Gaseous Form\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the gaseous form spell for 1 hour (no concentration required) or until you end the effect as a bonus action. This potion’s container seems to hold fog that moves and pours like water.\nPotion of Giant Strength\nPotion, rarity varies\nWhen you drink this potion, your Strength score changes for 1 hour. The type of giant determines the score (see the table below). The potion has no effect on you if your Strength is equal to or greater than that score.\nThis potion’s transparent liquid has floating in it a sliver of fingernail from a giant of the appropriate type. The potion of frost giant strength and the potion of stone giant strength have the same effect.\nType of Giant\nStrength\nRarity\nHill giant\n21\nUncommon\nFrost/stone giant\n23\nRare\nFire giant\n25\nRare\nCloud giant\n27\nVery rare\nStorm giant\n29\nLegendary\nPotion of Growth\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the enlarge effect of the enlarge/reduce spell for 1d4 hours (no concentration required). The red in the potion’s liquid continuously expands from a tiny bead to color the clear liquid around it and then contracts. Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, rarity varies\nYou regain hit points when you drink this potion. The number of hit points depends on the potion’s rarity, as shown in the Potions of Healing table. Whatever its potency, the potion’s red liquid glimmers when agitated.\nPotions of Healing\nPotion of ...\nRarity\nHP Regained\nHealing\nCommon\n2d4 + 2\nGreater healing\nUncommon\n4d4 + 4\nSuperior healing\nRare\n8d4 + 8\nSupreme healing\nVery rare\n10d4 + 20\nPotion of Heroism\nPotion, rare\nFor 1 hour after drinking it, you gain 10 temporary hit points that last for 1 hour. For the same duration, you are under the effect of the bless spell (no concentration required). This blue potion bubbles and steams as if boiling.\nPotion of Invisibility\nPotion, very rare\nThis potion’s container looks empty but feels as though it holds liquid. When you drink it, you become invisible for 1 hour. Anything you wear or carry is invisible with you. The effect ends early if you attack or cast a spell.\nPotion of Mind Reading\nPotion, rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13). The potion’s dense, purple liquid has an ovoid cloud of pink floating in it.\nPotion of Poison\nPotion, uncommon\nThis concoction looks, smells, and tastes like a potion of healing or other beneficial potion. However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.\nIf you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw. On a successful save, the poison damage you take on your subsequent turns decreases by 1d6. The poison ends when the damage decreases to 0.\nPotion of Resistance\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain resistance to one type of damage for 1 hour. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.\nd10\nDamage Type\n1\nAcid\n2\nCold\n3\nFire\n4\nForce\n5\nLightning\n6\nNecrotic\n7\nPoison\n8\nPsychic\n9\nRadiant\n10\nThunder\nPotion of Speed\nPotion, very rare\nWhen you drink this potion, you gain the effect of the haste spell for 1 minute (no concentration required).

The djinni appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 120 feet of you. It remains as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), to a maximum of 1 hour, or until it drops to 0 hit points. It then returns to its home plane.\nWhile summoned, the djinni is friendly to you and your companions. It obeys any commands you give it, no matter what language you use. If you fail to command it, the djinni defends itself against attackers but takes no other actions.\nAfter the djinni departs, it can’t be summoned again for 24 hours, and the ring becomes nonmagical if the djinni dies.\nRing of Elemental Command\nRing, legendary (requires attunement)\nThis ring is linked to one of the four Elemental Planes.

The spheres last as long as you concentrate (as if concentrating on a spell), up to 1 minute. Each sphere sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius.\nAs a bonus action, you can move each sphere up to 30 feet, but no farther than 120 feet away from you. When a creature other than you comes within 5 feet of a sphere, the sphere discharges lightning at that creature and disappears. That creature must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes lightning damage based on the number of spheres you created.\nSpheres\nLightning Damage\n1\n4d12\n2\n5d4\n3\n2d6\n4\n2d4\nShooting Stars.

When found, it contains 1d6 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 5th level into the ring by touching the ring as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the ring. If the ring can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile wearing this ring, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the ring is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nRing of Spell Turning\nRing, legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you have advantage on saving throws against any spell that targets only you (not in an area of effect). In addition, if you roll a 20 for the save and the spell is 7th level or lower, the spell has no effect on you and instead targets the caster, using the slot level, spell save DC, attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the caster.\nRing of Swimming\nRing, uncommon\nYou have a swimming speed of 40 feet while wearing this ring.\nRing of Telekinesis\nRing, very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you can cast the telekinesis spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren’t being worn or carried.\nRing of the Ram\nRing, rare (requires attunement)\nThis ring has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While wearing the ring, you can use an action to expend 1 to 3 of its charges to attack one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The ring produces a spectral ram’s head and makes its attack roll with a +7 bonus. On a hit, for each charge you spend, the target takes 2d10 force damage and is pushed 5 feet away from you.\nAlternatively, you can expend 1 to 3 of the ring’s charges as an action to try to break an object you can see within 60 feet of you that isn’t being worn or carried. The ring makes a Strength check with a +5 bonus for each charge you spend.\nRing of Three Wishes\nRing, legendary\nWhile wearing this ring, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 3 charges to cast the wish spell from it. The ring becomes nonmagical when you use the last charge.\nRing of Warmth\nRing, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you have resistance to cold damage. In addition, you and everything you wear and carry are unharmed by temperatures as low as −50 degrees Fahrenheit.\nRing of Water Walking\nRing, uncommon\nWhile wearing this ring, you can stand on and move across any liquid surface as if it were solid ground.\nRing of X-ray Vision\nRing, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this ring, you can use an action to speak its command word. When you do so, you can see into and through solid matter for 1 minute. This vision has a radius of 30 feet. To you, solid objects within that radius appear transparent and don’t prevent light from passing through them. The vision can penetrate 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, or up to 3 feet of wood or dirt. Thicker substances block the vision, as does a thin sheet of lead.\nWhenever you use the ring again before taking a long rest, you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of exhaustion.\nRobe of Eyes\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis robe is adorned with eyelike patterns.

The eyes on the robe can’t be closed or averted. Although you can close or avert your own eyes, you are never considered to be doing so while wearing this robe.\nA light spell cast on the robe or a daylight spell cast within 5 feet of the robe causes you to be blinded for 1 minute. At the end of each of your turns, you can make a Constitution saving throw (DC 11 for light or DC 15 for daylight), ending the blindness on a success.\nRobe of Scintillating Colors\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis robe has 3 charges, and it regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn. While you wear it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cause the garment to display a shifting pattern of dazzling hues until the end of your next turn. During this time, the robe sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Creatures that can see you have disadvantage on attack rolls against you. In addition, any creature in the bright light that can see you when the robe’s power is activated must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become stunned until the effect ends.\nRobe of Stars\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis black or dark blue robe is embroidered with small white or silver stars.

Daily at dusk, 1d6 removed stars reappear on the robe.\nWhile you wear the robe, you can use an action to enter the Astral Plane along with everything you are wearing and carrying. You remain there until you use an action to return to the plane you were on. You reappear in the last space you occupied, or if that space is occupied, the nearest unoccupied space.\nRobe of the Archmagi\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement by a sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)\nThis elegant garment is made from exquisite cloth of white, gray, or black and adorned with silvery runes. The robe’s color corresponds to the alignment for which the item was created. A white robe was made for good, gray for neutral, and black for evil. You can’t attune to a robe of the archmagirobe of the archmagi that doesn’t correspond to your alignment.\nYou gain these benefits while wearing the robe:\nIf you aren’t wearing armor, your base Armor Class is 15 + your Dexterity modifier.\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.\nYour spell save DC and spell attack bonus each increase by 2.\nRobe of Useful Items\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis robe has cloth patches of various shapes and colors covering it. While wearing the robe, you can use an action to detach one of the patches, causing it to become the object or creature it represents. Once the last patch is removed, the robe becomes an ordinary garment.\nThe robe has two of each of the following patches:\nDagger\nBullseye lantern (filled and lit)\nSteel mirror\n10-foot pole\nHempen rope (50 feet, coiled)\nSack\nIn addition, the robe has 4d4 other patches.

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\nRod of Alertness\nRod, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.\nThe rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Lordly Might\nRod, legendary (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.\nIf you press button 2, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 3, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Rulership\nRod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Security\nRod, very rare\nWhile holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.\nFor each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).\nWhen the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.\nRope of Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.\nIf you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\nRope of Entanglement\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\nScarab of Protection\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells.\nThe scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.\nScimitar of Speed\nWeapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, you can make one attack with it as a bonus action on each of your turns.\nShield, +1, +2, or +3\nArmor (shield), uncommon (+1), rare (+2), or very rare (+3)\nWhile holding this shield, you have a bonus to AC determined by the shield’s rarity. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.\nShield of Missile Attraction\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.\nCurse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.\nSlippers of Spider Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\nSovereign Glue\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.\nOne ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\nSpell Scroll\nScroll, varies\nA spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell’s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.\nIf the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\nOnce the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\nSpell Scroll\nSpell Level\nRarity\nSave DC\nAttack Bonus\nCantrip\nCommon\n13\n+5\n1st\nCommon\n13\n+5\n2nd\nUncommon\n13\n+5\n3rd\nUncommon\n15\n+7\n4th\nRare\n15\n+7\n5th\nRare\n17\n+9\n6th\nVery rare\n17\n+9\n7th\nVery rare\n18\n+10\n8th\nVery rare\n18\n+10\n9th\nLegendary\n19\n+11\nA wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.\nSpellguard Shield\nArmor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.\nSphere of Annihilation\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\nThe sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.\nIf you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.\nIf the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\nd100\nResult\n01–50\nThe sphere is destroyed.\n51–85\nThe sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.\n86–00\nA spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.\nStaff of Charming\nStaff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)\nWhile holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast charm person, command, or comprehend languages from it using your spell save DC.

You can’t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff’s intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

If you fail to avoid the effect, you take force damage equal to 16 × the number of charges in the staff. Every other creature in the area must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes an amount of damage based on how far away it is from the point of origin, as shown in the following table.

The staff becomes a giant constrictor snake under your control and acts on its own initiative count. By using a bonus action to speak the command word again, you return the staff to its normal form in a space formerly occupied by the snake.\nOn your turn, you can mentally command the snake if it is within 60 feet of you and you aren’t incapacitated. You decide what action the snake takes and where it moves during its next turn, or you can issue it a general command, such as to attack your enemies or guard a location.\nIf the snake is reduced to 0 hit points, it dies and reverts to its staff form. The staff then shatters and is destroyed. If the snake reverts to staff form before losing all its hit points, it regains all of them.\nStaff of the Woodlands\nStaff, rare (requires attunement by a druid)\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius. The tree appears ordinary but radiates a faint aura of transmutation magic if targeted by detect magic. While touching the tree and using another action to speak its command word, you return the staff to its normal form. Any creature in the tree falls when it reverts to a staff.\nStaff of Thunder and Lightning\nStaff, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

You can use an action to cause a bolt of lightning to leap from the staff’s tip in a line that is 5 feet wide and 120 feet long.

On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and isn’t deafened.\nThunder and Lightning. You can use an action to use the Lightning Strike and Thunderclap properties at the same time. Doing so doesn’t expend the daily use of those properties, only the use of this one.\nStaff of Withering\nStaff, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or warlock)\nThis staff has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nThe staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff.

The bonus is determined by its rarity.\nArmor of Invulnerability\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to nonmagical damage while you wear this armor. Additionally, you can use an action to make yourself immune to nonmagical damage for 10 minutes or until you are no longer wearing the armor. Once this special action is used, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nArmor of Resistance\nArmor (light, medium, or heavy), rare (requires attunement)\nYou have resistance to one type of damage while you wear this armor. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly from the options below.\nd10\nDamage Type\n1\nAcid\n2\nCold\n3\nFire\n4\nForce\n5\nLightning\n6\nNecrotic\n7\nPoison\n8\nPsychic\n9\nRadiant\n10\nThunder\nArmor of Vulnerability\nArmor (plate), rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you have resistance to one of the following damage types: bludgeoning, piercing, or slashing. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly.\nCurse. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an identify spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed, you have vulnerability to two of the three damage types associated with the armor (not the one to which it grants resistance).\nArrow-Catching Shield\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to AC against ranged attacks while you wield this shield. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC. In addition, whenever an attacker makes a ranged attack against a target within 5 feet of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of the attack instead.\nArrow of Slaying\nWeapon (arrow), very rare\nAn arrow of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both arrows of dragon slaying and arrows of blue dragon slaying. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with an arrow of slaying takes damage from the arrow, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra 6d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.\nOnce an arrow of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical arrow.\nOther types of magic ammunition of this kind exist, such as bolts of slaying meant for a crossbow, though arrows are most common.\nBag of Beans\nWondrous item, rare\nInside this heavy cloth bag are 3d4 dry beans. The bag weighs ½ pound plus ¼ pound for each bean it contains.\nIf you dump the bag’s contents out on the ground, they explode in a 10-foot radius, extending from the beans. Each creature in the area, including you, must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 5d4 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried.\nIf you remove a bean from the bag, plant it in dirt or sand, and then water it, the bean produces an effect 1 minute later from the ground where it was planted. The GM can choose an effect from the following table, determine it randomly, or create an effect.\nd100\nEffect\n01\n5d4 toadstools sprout. If a creature eats a toadstool, roll any die. On an odd roll, the eater must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 5d6 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 hour. On an even roll, the eater gains 5d6 temporary hit points for 1 hour.\n02–10\nA geyser erupts and spouts water, beer, berry juice, tea, vinegar, wine, or oil (GM’s choice) 30 feet into the air for 1d12 rounds.\n11–20\nA treant sprouts. There’s a 50 percent chance that the treant is chaotic evil and attacks.\n21–30\nAn animate, immobile stone statue in your likeness rises. It makes verbal threats against you. If you leave it and others come near, it describes you as the most heinous of villains and directs the newcomers to find and attack you. If you are on the same plane of existence as the statue, it knows where you are. The statue becomes inanimate after 24 hours.\n31–40\nA campfire with blue flames springs forth and burns for 24 hours (or until it is extinguished).\n41–50\n1d6 + 6 shriekers sprout\n51–60\n1d4 + 8 bright pink toads crawl forth. Whenever a toad is touched, it transforms into a Large or smaller monster of the GM’s choice. The monster remains for 1 minute, then disappears in a puff of bright pink smoke.\n61–70\nA hungry bulette burrows up and attacks.\n71–80\nA fruit tree grows. It has 1d10 + 20 fruit, 1d8 of which act as randomly determined magic potions, while one acts as an ingested poison of the GM’s choice. The tree vanishes after 1 hour. Picked fruit remains, retaining any magic for 30 days.\n81–90\nA nest of 1d4 + 3 eggs springs up. Any creature that eats an egg must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a successful save, a creature permanently increases its lowest ability score by 1, randomly choosing among equally low scores. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 force damage from an internal magical explosion.\n91–99\nA pyramid with a 60-foot-square base bursts upward. Inside is a sarcophagus containing a mummy lord. The pyramid is treated as the mummy lord’s lair, and its sarcophagus contains treasure of the GM’s choice.\n00\nA giant beanstalk sprouts, growing to a height of the GM’s choice. The top leads where the GM chooses, such as to a great view, a cloud giant’s castle, or a different plane of existence.\nBag of Devouring\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis bag superficially resembles a bag of holding but is a feeding orifice for a gigantic extradimensional creature. Turning the bag inside out closes the orifice.\nThe extradimensional creature attached to the bag can sense whatever is placed inside the bag. Animal or vegetable matter placed wholly in the bag is devoured and lost forever. When part of a living creature is placed in the bag, as happens when someone reaches inside it, there is a 50 percent chance that the creature is pulled inside the bag. A creature inside the bag can use its action to try to escape with a successful DC 15 Strength check. Another creature can use its action to reach into the bag to pull a creature out, doing so with a successful DC 20 Strength check (provided it isn’t pulled inside the bag first). Any creature that starts its turn inside the bag is devoured, its body destroyed.\nInanimate objects can be stored in the bag, which can hold a cubic foot of such material. However, once each day, the bag swallows any objects inside it and spits them out into another plane of existence. The GM determines the time and plane.\nIf the bag is pierced or torn, it is destroyed, and anything contained within it is transported to a random location on the Astral Plane.\nBag of Holding\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis bag has an interior space considerably larger than its outside dimensions, roughly 2 feet in diameter at the mouth and 4 feet deep. The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.\nIf the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.\nPlacing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\nBag of Tricks\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis ordinary bag, made from gray, rust, or tan cloth, appears empty. Reaching inside the bag, however, reveals the presence of a small, fuzzy object. The bag weighs ½ pound.\nYou can use an action to pull the fuzzy object from the bag and throw it up to 20 feet. When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a d8 and consulting the table that corresponds to the bag’s color.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or to give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature.\nOnce three fuzzy objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nGray Bag of Tricks\nd8\nCreature\n1\nWeasel\n2\nGiant rat\n3\nBadger\n4\nBoar\n5\nPanther\n6\nGiant badger\n7\nDire wolf\n8\nGiant elk\nRust Bag of Tricks\nd8\nCreature\n1\nRat\n2\nOwl\n3\nMastiff\n4\nGoat\n5\nGiant goat\n6\nGiant boar\n7\nLion\n8\nBrown bear\nTan Bag of Tricks\nd8\nCreature\n1\nJackal\n2\nApe\n3\nBaboon\n4\nAxe beak\n5\nBlack bear\n6\nGiant weasel\n7\nGiant hyena\n8\nTiger\nBead of Force\nWondrous item, rare\nThis small black sphere measures ¾ of an inch in diameter and weighs an ounce. Typically, 1d4 + 4 beads of force are found together.\nYou can use an action to throw the bead up to 60 feet. The bead explodes on impact and is destroyed. Each creature within a 10-foot radius of where the bead landed must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or take 5d4 force damage. A sphere of transparent force then encloses the area for 1 minute. Any creature that failed the save and is completely within the area is trapped inside this sphere. Creatures that succeeded on the save, or are partially within the area, are pushed away from the center of the sphere until they are no longer inside it. Only breathable air can pass through the sphere’s wall. No attack or other effect can.\nAn enclosed creature can use its action to push against the sphere’s wall, moving the sphere up to half the creature’s walking speed. The sphere can be picked up, and its magic causes it to weigh only 1 pound, regardless of the weight of creatures inside.\nBelt of Dwarvenkind\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, you gain the following benefits:\nYour Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20.\nYou have advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks made to interact with dwarves.\nIn addition, while attuned to the belt, you have a 50 percent chance each day at dawn of growing a full beard if you’re capable of growing one, or a visibly thicker beard if you already have one.\nIf you aren’t a dwarf, you gain the following additional benefits while wearing the belt:\nYou have advantage on saving throws against poison, and you have resistance against poison damage.\nYou have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet.\nYou can speak, read, and write Dwarvish.\nBelt of Giant Strength\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this belt, your Strength score changes to a score granted by the belt. If your Strength is already equal to or greater than the belt’s score, the item has no effect on you.\nSix varieties of this belt exist, corresponding with and having rarity according to the six kinds of true giants. The belt of stone giant strength and the belt of frost giant strength look different, but they have the same effect.\nType\nStrength\nRarity\nHill giant\n21\nRare\nStone/frost giant\n23\nVery rare\nFire giant\n25\nVery rare\nCloud giant\n27\nLegendary\nStorm giant\n29\nLegendary\nBerserker Axe\nWeapon (any axe), rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. In addition, while you are attuned to this weapon, your hit point maximum increases by 1 for each level you have attained.\nCurse. This axe is cursed, and becoming attuned to it extends the curse to you. As long as you remain cursed, you are unwilling to part with the axe, keeping it within reach at all times. You also have disadvantage on attack rolls with weapons other than this one, unless no foe is within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nWhenever a hostile creature damages you while the axe is in your possession, you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or go berserk. While berserk, you must use your action each round to attack the creature nearest to you with the axe. If you can make extra attacks as part of the Attack action, you use those extra attacks, moving to attack the next nearest creature after you fell your current target. If you have multiple possible targets, you attack one at random. You are berserk until you start your turn with no creatures within 60 feet of you that you can see or hear.\nBoots of Elvenkind\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently.\nBoots of Levitation\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use an action to cast the levitate spell on yourself at will.\nBoots of Speed\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, you can use a bonus action and click the boots’ heels together. If you do, the boots double your walking speed, and any creature that makes an opportunity attack against you has disadvantage on the attack roll. If you click your heels together again, you end the effect.\nWhen the boots’ property has been used for a total of 10 minutes, the magic ceases to function until you finish a long rest.\nBoots of Striding and Springing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these boots, your walking speed becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed isn’t reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor. In addition, you can jump three times the normal distance, though you can’t jump farther than your remaining movement would allow.\nBoots of the Winterlands\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese furred boots are snug and feel quite warm.

It then hovers beneath you and can be ridden in the air. It has a flying speed of 50 feet. It can carry up to 400 pounds, but its flying speed becomes 30 feet while carrying over 200 pounds. The broom stops hovering when you land.\nYou can send the broom to travel alone to a destination within 1 mile of you if you speak the command word, name the location, and are familiar with that place. The broom comes back to you when you speak another command word, provided that the broom is still within 1 mile of you.\nCandle of Invocation\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis slender taper is dedicated to a deity and shares that deity’s alignment. The candle’s alignment can be detected with the detect evil and good spell. The GM chooses the god and associated alignment or determines the alignment randomly.\nd20\nAlignment\n1–2\nChaotic evil\n3–4\nChaotic neutral\n5–7\nChaotic good\n8–9\nNeutral evil\n10–11\nNeutral\n12–13\nNeutral good\n14–15\nLawful evil\n16–17\nLawful neutral\n18–20\nLawful good\nThe candle’s magic is activated when the candle is lit, which requires an action. After burning for 4 hours, the candle is destroyed. You can snuff it out early for use at a later time. Deduct the time it burned in increments of 1 minute from the candle’s total burn time.\nWhile lit, the candle sheds dim light in a 30-foot radius. Any creature within that light whose alignment matches that of the candle makes attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks with advantage. In addition, a cleric or druid in the light whose alignment matches the candle’s can cast 1st-level spells he or she has prepared without expending spell slots, though the spell’s effect is as if cast with a 1st-level slot.\nAlternatively, when you light the candle for the first time, you can cast the gate spell with it. Doing so destroys the candle.\nCape of the Mountebank\nWondrous item, rare\nThis cape smells faintly of brimstone. While wearing it, you can use it to cast the dimension door spell as an action. This property of the cape can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nWhen you disappear, you leave behind a cloud of smoke, and you appear in a similar cloud of smoke at your destination. The smoke lightly obscures the space you left and the space you appear in, and it dissipates at the end of your next turn. A light or stronger wind disperses the smoke.\nCarpet of Flying\nWondrous item, very rare\nYou can speak the carpet’s command word as an action to make the carpet hover and fly. It moves according to your spoken directions, provided that you are within 30 feet of it.\nFour sizes of carpet of flying exist.

You can strike it as an action, pointing it at an object within 120 feet of you that can be opened, such as a door, lid, or lock. The chime issues a clear tone, and one lock or latch on the object opens unless the sound can’t reach the object. If no locks or latches remain, the object itself opens. The chime can be used ten times. After the tenth time, it cracks and becomes useless.\nCirclet of Blasting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the scorching ray spell with it.

While scrying with the crystal ball, you have truesight with a radius of 120 feet centered on the spell’s sensor.\nCube of Force\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis cube is about an inch across. Each face has a distinct marking on it that can be pressed. The cube starts with 36 charges, and it regains 1d20 expended charges daily at dawn.\nYou can use an action to press one of the cube’s faces, expending a number of charges based on the chosen face, as shown in the Cube of Force Faces table. Each face has a different effect. If the cube has insufficient charges remaining, nothing happens. Otherwise, a barrier of invisible force springs into existence, forming a cube 15 feet on a side. The barrier is centered on you, moves with you, and lasts for 1 minute, until you use an action to press the cube’s sixth face, or the cube runs out of charges. You can change the barrier’s effect by pressing a different face of the cube and expending the requisite number of charges, resetting the duration.\nIf your movement causes the barrier to come into contact with a solid object that can’t pass through the cube, you can’t move any closer to that object as long as the barrier remains.\nCube of Force Faces\nFace\nCharges\nEffect\n1\n1\nGases, wind, and fog can’t pass through the barrier.\n2\n2\nNonliving matter can’t pass through the barrier.

The other sides are linked to planes determined by the GM.\nYou can use an action to press one side of the cube to cast the gate spell with it, opening a portal to the plane keyed to that side. Alternatively, if you use an action to press one side twice, you can cast the plane shift spell (save DC 17) with the cube and transport the targets to the plane keyed to that side.\nThe cube has 3 charges. Each use of the cube expends 1 charge. The cube regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nDagger of Venom\nWeapon (dagger), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nYou can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d10 poison damage and become poisoned for 1 minute. The dagger can’t be used this way again until the next dawn.\nDancing Sword\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use a bonus action to toss this magic sword into the air and speak the command word. When you do so, the sword begins to hover, flies up to 30 feet, and attacks one creature of your choice within 5 feet of it. The sword uses your attack roll and ability score modifier to damage rolls.\nWhile the sword hovers, you can use a bonus action to cause it to fly up to 30 feet to another spot within 30 feet of you. As part of the same bonus action, you can cause the sword to attack one creature within 5 feet of it.\nAfter the hovering sword attacks for the fourth time, it flies up to 30 feet and tries to return to your hand. If you have no hand free, it falls to the ground at your feet. If the sword has no unobstructed path to you, it moves as close to you as it can and then falls to the ground. It also ceases to hover if you grasp it or move more than 30 feet away from it.\nDecanter of Endless Water\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis stoppered flask sloshes when shaken, as if it contains water. The decanter weighs 2 pounds.\nYou can use an action to remove the stopper and speak one of three command words, whereupon an amount of fresh water or salt water (your choice) pours out of the flask. The water stops pouring out at the start of your next turn. Choose from the following options:\nStream produces 1 gallon of water.\nFountain produces 5 gallons of water.\nGeyser produces 30 gallons of water that gushes forth in a geyser 30 feet long and 1 foot wide. As a bonus action while holding the decanter, you can aim the geyser at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 13 Strength saving throw or take 1d4 bludgeoning damage and fall prone. Instead of a creature, you can target an object that isn’t being worn or carried and that weighs no more than 200 pounds. The object is either knocked over or pushed up to 15 feet away from you.\nDeck of Illusions\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis box contains a set of parchment cards. A full deck has 34 cards. A deck found as treasure is usually missing 1d20 − 1 cards.\nThe magic of the deck functions only if cards are drawn at random (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). You can use an action to draw a card at random from the deck and throw it to the ground at a point within 30 feet of you.\nAn illusion of one or more creatures forms over the thrown card and remains until dispelled. An illusory creature appears real, of the appropriate size, and behaves as if it were a real creature except that it can do no harm. While you are within 120 feet of the illusory creature and can see it, you can use an action to move it magically anywhere within 30 feet of its card. Any physical interaction with the illusory creature reveals it to be an illusion, because objects pass through it. Someone who uses an action to visually inspect the creature identifies it as illusory with a successful DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check. The creature then appears translucent.\nThe illusion lasts until its card is moved or the illusion is dispelled. When the illusion ends, the image on its card disappears, and that card can’t be used again.\nPlaying Card\nIllusion\nAce of hearts\nRed dragon\nKing of hearts\nKnight and four guards\nQueen of hearts\nSuccubus or incubus\nJack of hearts\nDruid\nTen of hearts\nCloud giant\nNine of hearts\nEttin\nEight of hearts\nBugbear\nTwo of hearts\nGoblin\nAce of diamonds\nTrademarked eyebeast\nKing of diamonds\nArchmage and mage apprentice\nQueen of diamonds\nNight hag\nJack of diamonds\nAssassin\nTen of diamonds\nFire giant\nNine of diamonds\nOgre mage\nEight of diamonds\nGnoll\nTwo of diamonds\nKobold\nAce of spades\nLich\nKing of spades\nPriest and two acolytes\nQueen of spades\nMedusa\nJack of spades\nVeteran\nTen of spades\nFrost giant\nNine of spades\nTroll\nEight of spades\nHobgoblin\nTwo of spades\nGoblin\nAce of clubs\nIron golem\nKing of clubs\nBandit captain and three bandits\nQueen of clubs\nErinyes\nJack of clubs\nBerserker\nTen of clubs\nHill giant\nNine of clubs\nOgre\nEight of clubs\nOrc\nTwo of clubs\nKobold\nJokers (2)\nYou (the deck’s owner)\nDeck of Many Things\nWondrous item, legendary\nUsually found in a box or pouch, this deck contains a number of cards made of ivory or vellum. Most (75 percent) of these decks have only thirteen cards, but the rest have twenty-two.\nBefore you draw a card, you must declare how many cards you intend to draw and then draw them randomly (you can use an altered deck of playing cards to simulate the deck). Any cards drawn in excess of this number have no effect. Otherwise, as soon as you draw a card from the deck, its magic takes effect. You must draw each card no more than 1 hour after the previous draw. If you fail to draw the chosen number, the remaining number of cards fly from the deck on their own and take effect all at once.\nOnce a card is drawn, it fades from existence. Unless the card is the Fool or the Jester, the card reappears in the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\nPlaying Card\nCard\nAce of diamonds\nVizier*\nKing of diamonds\nSun\nQueen of diamonds\nMoon\nJack of diamonds\nStar\nTwo of diamonds\nComet*\nAce of hearts\nThe Fates*\nKing of hearts\nThrone\nQueen of hearts\nKey\nJack of hearts\nKnight\nTwo of hearts\nGem*\nAce of clubs\nTalons*\nKing of clubs\nThe Void\nQueen of clubs\nFlames\nJack of clubs\nSkull\nTwo of clubs\nIdiot*\nAce of spades\nDonjon*\nKing of spades\nRuin\nQueen of spades\nEuryale\nJack of spades\nRogue\nTwo of spades\nBalance*\nJoker (with TM)\nFool*\nJoker (without TM)\nJester\n*Found only in a deck with twenty-two cards\nBalance. Your mind suffers a wrenching alteration, causing your alignment to change. Lawful becomes chaotic, good becomes evil, and vice versa. If you are true neutral or unaligned, this card has no effect on you.\nComet. If you single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or group of monsters you encounter, you gain experience points enough to gain one level. Otherwise, this card has no effect.\nDonjon. You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything you were wearing and carrying stays behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You can’t be located by any divination magic, but a wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.\nEuryale. The card’s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a −2 penalty on saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of The Fates card can end this curse.\nThe Fates. Reality’s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the card’s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.\nFlames. A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and plagues your life, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.\nFool. You lose 10,000 XP, discard this card, and draw from the deck again, counting both draws as one of your declared draws. If losing that much XP would cause you to lose a level, you instead lose an amount that leaves you with just enough XP to keep your level.\nGem. Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 gp each or fifty gems worth 1,000 gp each appear at your feet.\nIdiot. Permanently reduce your Intelligence by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.\nJester. You gain 10,000 XP, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.\nKey. A rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears in your hands. The GM chooses the weapon.\nKnight. You gain the service of a 4th-level fighter who appears in a space you choose within 30 feet of you. The fighter is of the same race as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the fates have drawn him or her to you. You control this character.\nMoon. You are granted the ability to cast the wish spell 1d3 times.\nRogue. A nonplayer character of the GM’s choice becomes hostile toward you. The identity of your new enemy isn’t known until the NPC or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility toward you.\nRuin. All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.\nSkull. You summon an avatar of death—a ghostly humanoid skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. It appears in a space of the GM’s choice within 10 feet of you and attacks you, warning all others that you must win the battle alone. The avatar fights until you die or it drops to 0 hit points, whereupon it disappears. If anyone tries to help you, the helper summons its own avatar of death. A creature slain by an avatar of death can’t be restored to life.\nAvatar of Death\nMedium undead, neutral evil\nArmor Class 20\nHit Points half the hit point maximum of its summoner\nSpeed 60 ft., fly 60 ft.

The avatar is immune to features that turn undead.\nActions\nReaping Scythe. The avatar sweeps its spectral scythe through a creature within 5 feet of it, dealing 7 (1d8 + 3) slashing damage plus 4 (1d8) necrotic damage.\nStar. Increase one of your ability scores by 2. The score can exceed 20 but can’t exceed 24.\nSun. You gain 50,000 XP, and a wondrous item (which the GM determines randomly) appears in your hands.\nTalons. Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession aren’t destroyed but do vanish.\nThrone. You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently in the hands of monsters, which you must clear out before you can claim the keep as yours.\nVizier. At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question. Besides information, the answer helps you solve a puzzling problem or other dilemma. In other words, the knowledge comes with wisdom on how to apply it.\nThe Void. This black card spells disaster. Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the GM’s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is incapacitated. A wish spell can’t restore your soul, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds it. You draw no more cards.\nDefender\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe first time you attack with the sword on each of your turns, you can transfer some or all of the sword’s bonus to your Armor Class, instead of using the bonus on any attacks that turn. For example, you could reduce the bonus to your attack and damage rolls to +1 and gain a +2 bonus to AC. The adjusted bonuses remain in effect until the start of your next turn, although you must hold the sword to gain a bonus to AC from it.\nDemon Armor\nArmor (plate), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, and you can understand and speak Abyssal. In addition, the armor’s clawed gauntlets turn unarmed strikes with your hands into magic weapons that deal slashing damage, with a +1 bonus to attack rolls and damage rolls and a damage die of 1d8.\nCurse. Once you don this cursed armor, you can’t doff it unless you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. While wearing the armor, you have disadvantage on attack rolls against demons and on saving throws against their spells and special abilities.\nDimensional Shackles\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place these shackles on an incapacitated creature. The shackles adjust to fit a creature of Small to Large size. In addition to serving as mundane manacles, the shackles prevent a creature bound by them from using any method of extradimensional movement, including teleportation or travel to a different plane of existence. They don’t prevent the creature from passing through an interdimensional portal.\nYou and any creature you designate when you use the shackles can use an action to remove them. Once every 30 days, the bound creature can make a DC 30 Strength (Athletics) check. On a success, the creature breaks free and destroys the shackles.\nDragon Scale Mail\nArmor (scale mail), very rare (requires attunement)\nDragon scale mail is made of the scales of one kind of dragon. Sometimes dragons collect their cast-off scales and gift them to humanoids. Other times, hunters carefully skin and preserve the hide of a dead dragon. In either case, dragon scale mail is highly valued.\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC, you have advantage on saving throws against the Frightful Presence and breath weapons of dragons, and you have resistance to one damage type that is determined by the kind of dragon that provided the scales (see the table).\nAdditionally, you can focus your senses as an action to magically discern the distance and direction to the closest dragon within 30 miles of you that is of the same type as the armor. This special action can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nDragon\nResistance\nBlack\nAcid\nBlue\nLightning\nBrass\nFire\nBronze\nLightning\nCopper\nAcid\nGold\nFire\nGreen\nPoison\nRed\nFire\nSilver\nCold\nWhite\nCold\nDragon Slayer\nWeapon (any sword), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nWhen you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon’s type. For the purpose of this weapon, dragon refers to any creature with the dragon type, including dragon turtles and wyverns.\nDust of Disappearance\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature.\nDust of Dryness\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis small packet contains 1d6 + 4 pinches of dust. You can use an action to sprinkle a pinch of it over water. The dust turns a cube of water 15 feet on a side into one marble-sized pellet, which floats or rests near where the dust was sprinkled. The pellet’s weight is negligible.\nSomeone can use an action to smash the pellet against a hard surface, causing the pellet to shatter and release the water the dust absorbed. Doing so ends that pellet’s magic.\nAn elemental composed mostly of water that is exposed to a pinch of the dust must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw, taking 10d6 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\nDust of Sneezing and Choking\nWondrous item, uncommon\nFound in a small container, this powder resembles very fine sand. It appears to be dust of disappearance, and an identify spell reveals it to be such. There is enough of it for one use.\nWhen you use an action to throw a handful of the dust into the air, you and each creature that needs to breathe within 30 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become unable to breathe, while sneezing uncontrollably. A creature affected in this way is incapacitated and suffocating. As long as it is conscious, a creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on it on a success. The lesser restoration spell can also end the effect on a creature.\nDwarven Plate\nArmor (plate), very rare\nWhile wearing this armor, you gain a +2 bonus to AC. In addition, if an effect moves you against your will along the ground, you can use your reaction to reduce the distance you are moved by up to 10 feet.\nDwarven Thrower\nWeapon (warhammer), very rare (requires attunement by a dwarf)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. It has the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you hit with a ranged attack using this weapon, it deals an extra 1d8 damage or, if the target is a giant, 2d8 damage. Immediately after the attack, the weapon flies back to your hand.\nEfficient Quiver\nWondrous item, uncommon\nEach of the quiver’s three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty arrows, bolts, or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen javelins or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, quarterstaffs, or spears.\nYou can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.\nEfreeti Bottle\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an efreeti appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.\nThe first time the bottle is opened, the GM rolls to determine what happens.\nd100\nEffect\n01–10\nThe efreeti attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the efreeti disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.\n11–90\nThe efreeti serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the efreeti returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can’t be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the efreeti escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.\n91–00\nThe efreeti can cast the wish spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.\nElemental Gem\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis gem contains a mote of elemental energy. When you use an action to break the gem, an elemental is summoned as if you had cast the conjure elemental spell, and the gem’s magic is lost. The type of gem determines the elemental summoned by the spell.\nGem\nSummoned Elemental\nBlue sapphire\nAir elemental\nYellow diamond\nEarth elemental\nRed corundum\nFire elemental\nEmerald\nWater elemental\nElven Chain\nArmor (chain shirt), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to AC while you wear this armor. You are considered proficient with this armor even if you lack proficiency with medium armor.\nEversmoking Bottle\nWondrous item, uncommon\nSmoke leaks from the lead-stoppered mouth of this brass bottle, which weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke pours out in a 60-foot radius from the bottle. The cloud’s area is heavily obscured. Each minute the bottle remains open and within the cloud, the radius increases by 10 feet until it reaches its maximum radius of 120 feet.\nThe cloud persists as long as the bottle is open. Closing the bottle requires you to speak its command word as an action. Once the bottle is closed, the cloud disperses after 10 minutes. A moderate wind (11 to 20 miles per hour) can also disperse the smoke after 1 minute, and a strong wind (21 or more miles per hour) can do so after 1 round.\nEyes of Charming\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. They have 3 charges. While wearing them, you can expend 1 charge as an action to cast the charm person spell (save DC 13) on a humanoid within 30 feet of you, provided that you and the target can see each other. The lenses regain all expended charges daily at dawn.\nEyes of Minute Seeing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you can see much better than normal out to a range of 1 foot. You have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) checks that rely on sight while searching an area or studying an object within that range.\nEyes of the Eagle\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese crystal lenses fit over the eyes. While wearing them, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight. In conditions of clear visibility, you can make out details of even extremely distant creatures and objects as small as 2 feet across.\nFeather Token\nWondrous item, rare\nThis tiny object looks like a feather. Different types of feather tokens exist, each with a different single-use effect. The GM chooses the kind of token or determines it randomly.\nd100\nFeather Token\n01–20\nAnchor\n21–35\nBird\n36–50\nFan\n51–65\nSwan boat\n66–90\nTree\n91–00\nWhip\nAnchor. You can use an action to touch the token to a boat or ship. For the next 24 hours, the vessel can’t be moved by any means. Touching the token to the vessel again ends the effect. When the effect ends, the token disappears.\nBird. You can use an action to toss the token 5 feet into the air. The token disappears and an enormous, multicolored bird takes its place. The bird has the statistics of a roc, but it obeys your simple commands and can’t attack. It can carry up to 500 pounds while flying at its maximum speed (16 miles an hour for a maximum of 144 miles per day, with a one-hour rest for every 3 hours of flying), or 1,000 pounds at half that speed. The bird disappears after flying its maximum distance for a day or if it drops to 0 hit points. You can dismiss the bird as an action.\nFan. If you are on a boat or ship, you can use an action to toss the token up to 10 feet in the air. The token disappears, and a giant flapping fan takes its place. The fan floats and creates a wind strong enough to fill the sails of one ship, increasing its speed by 5 miles per hour for 8 hours. You can dismiss the fan as an action.\nSwan Boat. You can use an action to touch the token to a body of water at least 60 feet in diameter. The token disappears, and a 50-foot-long, 20-foot-wide boat shaped like a swan takes its place. The boat is self-propelled and moves across water at a speed of 6 miles per hour. You can use an action while on the boat to command it to move or to turn up to 90 degrees. The boat can carry up to thirty-two Medium or smaller creatures. A Large creature counts as four Medium creatures, while a Huge creature counts as nine. The boat remains for 24 hours and then disappears. You can dismiss the boat as an action.\nTree. You must be outdoors to use this token. You can use an action to touch it to an unoccupied space on the ground. The token disappears, and in its place a nonmagical oak tree springs into existence. The tree is 60 feet tall and has a 5-foot-diameter trunk, and its branches at the top spread out in a 20-foot radius.\nWhip. You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.\nFigurine of Wondrous Power\nWondrous item, rarity by figurine\nA figurine of wondrous power is a statuette of a beast small enough to fit in a pocket. If you use an action to speak the command word and throw the figurine to a point on the ground within 60 feet of you, the figurine becomes a living creature. If the space where the creature would appear is occupied by other creatures or objects, or if there isn’t enough space for the creature, the figurine doesn’t become a creature.\nThe creature is friendly to you and your companions. It understands your languages and obeys your spoken commands. If you issue no commands, the creature defends itself but takes no other actions.\nThe creature exists for a duration specific to each figurine. At the end of the duration, the creature reverts to its figurine form. It reverts to a figurine early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word again while touching it. When the creature becomes a figurine again, its property can’t be used again until a certain amount of time has passed, as specified in the figurine’s description.\nBronze Griffon (Rare). This bronze statuette is of a griffon rampant. It can become a griffon for up to 6 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.\nEbony Fly (Rare).

These gold statuettes of lions are always created in pairs. You can use one figurine or both simultaneously. Each can become a lion for up to 1 hour. Once a lion has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nIvory Goats (Rare). These ivory statuettes of goats are always created in sets of three. Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\nThe goat of traveling can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can’t be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\nThe goat of travail becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 30 days have passed.\nThe goat of terror becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can’t attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a +1 lance, and the other becomes a +2 longsword. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Once it successfully saves against the effect, a creature is immune to the goat’s aura for the next 24 hours. Once the figurine has been used, it can’t be used again until 15 days have passed.\nMarble Elephant (Rare). This marble statuette is about 4 inches high and long. It can become an elephant for up to 24 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nObsidian Steed (Very Rare). This polished obsidian horse can become a nightmare for up to 24 hours. The nightmare fights only to defend itself. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 5 days have passed.\nIf you have a good alignment, the figurine has a 10 percent chance each time you use it to ignore your orders, including a command to revert to figurine form. If you mount the nightmare while it is ignoring your orders, you and the nightmare are instantly transported to a random location on the plane of Hades, where the nightmare reverts to figurine form.\nOnyx Dog (Rare). This onyx statuette of a dog can become a mastiff for up to 6 hours. The mastiff has an Intelligence of 8 and can speak Common. It also has darkvision out to a range of 60 feet and can see invisible creatures and objects within that range. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nSerpentine Owl (Rare). This serpentine statuette of an owl can become a giant owl for up to 8 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. The owl can telepathically communicate with you at any range if you and it are on the same plane of existence.\nSilver Raven (Uncommon). This silver statuette of a raven can become a raven for up to 12 hours. Once it has been used, it can’t be used again until 2 days have passed. While in raven form, the figurine allows you to cast the animal messenger spell on it at will.\nFlame Tongue\nWeapon (any sword), rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use a bonus action to speak this magic sword’s command word, causing flames to erupt from the blade. These flames shed bright light in a 40-foot radius and dim light for an additional 40 feet. While the sword is ablaze, it deals an extra 2d6 fire damage to any target it hits. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sword.\nFolding Boat\nWondrous item, rare\nThis object appears as a wooden box that measures 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep. It weighs 4 pounds and floats. It can be opened to store items inside. This item also has three command words, each requiring you to use an action to speak it.\nOne command word causes the box to unfold into a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet deep. The boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. The boat can hold up to four Medium creatures comfortably.\nThe second command word causes the box to unfold into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The ship has a deck, rowing seats, five sets of oars, a steering oar, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The ship can hold fifteen Medium creatures comfortably.\nWhen the box becomes a vessel, its weight becomes that of a normal vessel its size, and anything that was stored in the box remains in the boat.\nThe third command word causes the folding boat to fold back into a box, provided that no creatures are aboard. Any objects in the vessel that can’t fit inside the box remain outside the box as it folds. Any objects in the vessel that can fit inside the box do so.\nFrost Brand\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you hit with an attack using this magic sword, the target takes an extra 1d6 cold damage.

This property can be used no more than once per hour.\nGauntlets of Ogre Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYour Strength score is 19 while you wear these gauntlets. They have no effect on you if your Strength is already 19 or higher.\nGem of Brightness\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis prism has 50 charges. While you are holding it, you can use an action to speak one of three command words to cause one of the following effects:\nThe first command word causes the gem to shed bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This effect doesn’t expend a charge. It lasts until you use a bonus action to repeat the command word or until you use another function of the gem.\nThe second command word expends 1 charge and causes the gem to fire a brilliant beam of light at one creature you can see within 60 feet of you. The creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become blinded for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe third command word expends 5 charges and causes the gem to flare with blinding light in a 30-foot cone originating from it. Each creature in the cone must make a saving throw as if struck by the beam created with the second command word.\nWhen all of the gem’s charges are expended, the gem becomes a nonmagical jewel worth 50 gp.\nGem of Seeing\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis gem has 3 charges.

You can also use a bonus action to speak the armor’s command word and cause the armor to assume the appearance of a normal set of clothing or some other kind of armor. You decide what it looks like, including color, style, and accessories, but the armor retains its normal bulk and weight. The illusory appearance lasts until you use this property again or remove the armor.\nGloves of Missile Snaring\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThese gloves seem to almost meld into your hands when you don them. When a ranged weapon attack hits you while you’re wearing them, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Dexterity modifier, provided that you have a free hand. If you reduce the damage to 0, you can catch the missile if it is small enough for you to hold in that hand.\nGloves of Swimming and Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing these gloves, climbing and swimming don’t cost you extra movement, and you gain a +5 bonus to Strength (Athletics) checks made to climb or swim.\nGoggles of Night\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing these dark lenses, you have darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, wearing the goggles increases its range by 60 feet.\nHammer of Thunderbolts\nWeapon (maul), legendary\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nGiant’s Bane (Requires Attunement). You must be wearing a belt of giant strength (any variety) and gauntlets of ogre power to attune to this weapon. The attunement ends if you take off either of those items. While you are attuned to this weapon and holding it, your Strength score increases by 4 and can exceed 20, but not 30. When you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon against a giant, the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or die.\nThe hammer also has 5 charges. While attuned to it, you can expend 1 charge and make a ranged weapon attack with the hammer, hurling it as if it had the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. If the attack hits, the hammer unleashes a thunderclap audible out to 300 feet. The target and every creature within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or be stunned until the end of your next turn. The hammer regains 1d4 + 1 expended charges daily at dawn.\nHandy Haversack\nWondrous item, rare\nThis backpack has a central pouch and two side pouches, each of which is an extradimensional space. Each side pouch can hold up to 20 pounds of material, not exceeding a volume of 2 cubic feet. The large central pouch can hold up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. The backpack always weighs 5 pounds, regardless of its contents.\nPlacing an object in the haversack follows the normal rules for interacting with objects. Retrieving an item from the haversack requires you to use an action. When you reach into the haversack for a specific item, the item is always magically on top.\nThe haversack has a few limitations. If it is overloaded, or if a sharp object pierces it or tears it, the haversack ruptures and is destroyed. If the haversack is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If the haversack is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, and the haversack must be put right before it can be used again. If a breathing creature is placed within the haversack, the creature can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing the haversack inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\nHat of Disguise\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the disguise self spell from it at will. The spell ends if the hat is removed.\nHeadband of Intellect\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYour Intelligence score is 19 while you wear this headband. It has no effect on you if your Intelligence is already 19 or higher.\nHelm of Brilliance\nWondrous item, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis dazzling helm is set with 1d10 diamonds, 2d10 rubies, 3d10 fire opals, and 4d10 opals. Any gem pried from the helm crumbles to dust. When all the gems are removed or destroyed, the helm loses its magic.\nYou gain the following benefits while wearing it:\nYou can use an action to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18), using one of the helm’s gems of the specified type as a component: daylight (opal), fireball (fire opal), prismatic spray (diamond), or wall of fire (ruby). The gem is destroyed when the spell is cast and disappears from the helm.\nAs long as it has at least one diamond, the helm emits dim light in a 30-foot radius when at least one undead is within that area. Any undead that starts its turn in that area takes 1d6 radiant damage.\nAs long as the helm has at least one ruby, you have resistance to fire damage.\nAs long as the helm has at least one fire opal, you can use an action and speak a command word to cause one weapon you are holding to burst into flames. The flames emit bright light in a 10-foot radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet. The flames are harmless to you and the weapon. When you hit with an attack using the blazing weapon, the target takes an extra 1d6 fire damage. The flames last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or stow the weapon.\nRoll a d20 if you are wearing the helm and take fire damage as a result of failing a saving throw against a spell. On a roll of 1, the helm emits beams of light from its remaining gems. Each creature within 60 feet of the helm other than you must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be struck by a beam, taking radiant damage equal to the number of gems in the helm. The helm and its gems are then destroyed.\nHelm of Comprehending Languages\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the comprehend languages spell from it at will.\nHelm of Telepathy\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.\nWhile focusing on a creature with detect thoughts, you can use an action to cast the suggestion spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nHelm of Teleportation\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nThis helm has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the teleport spell from it. The helm regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nHoly Avenger\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement by a paladin)\nYou gain a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a fiend or an undead with it, that creature takes an extra 2d10 radiant damage.\nWhile you hold the drawn sword, it creates an aura in a 10-foot radius around you. You and all creatures friendly to you in the aura have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects. If you have 17 or more levels in the paladin class, the radius of the aura increases to 30 feet.\nHorn of Blasting\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to speak the horn’s command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d6 thunder damage and is deafened for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t deafened. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take 10d6 thunder damage instead of 5d6.\nEach use of the horn’s magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals 10d6 fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.\nHorn of Valhalla\nWondrous item, rare (silver or brass), very rare (bronze), or legendary (iron)\nYou can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the Valhalla appear within 60 feet of you. They use the statistics of a berserker. They return to Valhalla after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can’t be used again until 7 days have passed.\nFour types of horn of Valhalla are known to exist, each made of a different metal. The horn’s type determines how many berserkers answer its summons, as well as the requirement for its use. The GM chooses the horn’s type or determines it randomly.\nd100\nHorn Type\nBerserkers Summoned\nRequirement\n01–40\nSilver\n2d4 + 2\nNone\n41–75\nBrass\n3d4 + 3\nProficiency with all simple weapons\n76–90\nBronze\n4d4 + 4\nProficiency with all medium armor\n91–00\nIron\n5d4 + 5\nProficiency with all martial weapons\nIf you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned berserkers attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.\nHorseshoes of a Zephyr\nWondrous item, very rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they allow the creature to move normally while floating 4 inches above the ground. This effect means the creature can cross or stand above nonsolid or unstable surfaces, such as water or lava. The creature leaves no tracks and ignores difficult terrain. In addition, the creature can move at normal speed for up to 12 hours a day without suffering exhaustion from a forced march.\nHorseshoes of Speed\nWondrous item, rare\nThese iron horseshoes come in a set of four. While all four shoes are affixed to the hooves of a horse or similar creature, they increase the creature’s walking speed by 30 feet.\nImmovable Rod\nRod, uncommon\nThis flat iron rod has a button on one end. You can use an action to press the button, which causes the rod to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the rod doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The rod can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the rod to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed rod up to 10 feet on a success.\nInstant Fortress\nWondrous item, rare\nYou can use an action to place this 1-inch metal cube on the ground and speak its command word. The cube rapidly grows into a fortress that remains until you use an action to speak the command word that dismisses it, which works only if the fortress is empty.\nThe fortress is a square tower, 20 feet on a side and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a battlement atop it. Its interior is divided into two floors, with a ladder running along one wall to connect them. The ladder ends at a trapdoor leading to the roof. When activated, the tower has a small door on the side facing you. The door opens only at your command, which you can speak as a bonus action. It is immune to the knock spell and similar magic, such as that of a chime of opening.\nEach creature in the area where the fortress appears must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d10 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. In either case, the creature is pushed to an unoccupied space outside but next to the fortress. Objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried take this damage and are pushed automatically.\nThe tower is made of adamantine, and its magic prevents it from being tipped over. The roof, the door, and the walls each have 100 hit points, immunity to damage from nonmagical weapons excluding siege weapons, and resistance to all other damage. Only a wish spell can repair the fortress (this use of the spell counts as replicating a spell of 8th level or lower). Each casting of wish causes the roof, the door, or one wall to regain 50 hit points.\nIoun Stone\nWondrous item, rarity varies (requires attunement)\nAn Ioun stone is named after Ioun, a god of knowledge and prophecy revered on some worlds. Many types of Ioun stone exist, each type a distinct combination of shape and color.\nWhen you use an action to toss one of these stones into the air, the stone orbits your head at a distance of 1d3 feet and confers a benefit to you. Thereafter, another creature must use an action to grasp or net the stone to separate it from you, either by making a successful attack roll against AC 24 or a successful DC 24 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. You can use an action to seize and stow the stone, ending its effect.\nA stone has AC 24, 10 hit points, and resistance to all damage. It is considered to be an object that is being worn while it orbits your head.\nAbsorption (Very Rare). While this pale lavender ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 4th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 20 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nAgility (Very Rare). Your Dexterity score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this deep red sphere orbits your head.\nAwareness (Rare). You can’t be surprised while this dark blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nFortitude (Very Rare). Your Constitution score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pink rhomboid orbits your head.\nGreater Absorption (Legendary). While this marbled lavender and green ellipsoid orbits your head, you can use your reaction to cancel a spell of 8th level or lower cast by a creature you can see and targeting only you.\nOnce the stone has canceled 50 levels of spells, it burns out and turns dull gray, losing its magic. If you are targeted by a spell whose level is higher than the number of spell levels the stone has left, the stone can’t cancel it.\nInsight (Very Rare). Your Wisdom score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this incandescent blue sphere orbits your head.\nIntellect (Very Rare). Your Intelligence score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled scarlet and blue sphere orbits your head. Leadership (Very Rare). Your Charisma score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this marbled pink and green sphere orbits your head. Mastery (Legendary). Your proficiency bonus increases by 1 while this pale green prism orbits your head.\nProtection (Rare). You gain a +1 bonus to AC while this dusty rose prism orbits your head.\nRegeneration (Legendary). You regain 15 hit points at the end of each hour this pearly white spindle orbits your head, provided that you have at least 1 hit point.\nReserve (Rare). This vibrant purple prism stores spells cast into it, holding them until you use them. The stone can store up to 3 levels worth of spells at a time. When found, it contains 1d4 − 1 levels of stored spells chosen by the GM.\nAny creature can cast a spell of 1st through 3rd level into the stone by touching it as the spell is cast. The spell has no effect, other than to be stored in the stone. If the stone can’t hold the spell, the spell is expended without effect. The level of the slot used to cast the spell determines how much space it uses.\nWhile this stone orbits your head, you can cast any spell stored in it. The spell uses the slot level, spell save DC, spell attack bonus, and spellcasting ability of the original caster, but is otherwise treated as if you cast the spell. The spell cast from the stone is no longer stored in it, freeing up space.\nStrength (Very Rare). Your Strength score increases by 2, to a maximum of 20, while this pale blue rhomboid orbits your head.\nSustenance (Rare). You don’t need to eat or drink while this clear spindle orbits your head.\nIron Bands of Binding\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rusty iron sphere measures 3 inches in diameter and weighs 1 pound. You can use an action to speak the command word and throw the sphere at a Huge or smaller creature you can see within 60 feet of you. As the sphere moves through the air, it opens into a tangle of metal bands.\nMake a ranged attack roll with an attack bonus equal to your Dexterity modifier plus your proficiency bonus. On a hit, the target is restrained until you take a bonus action to speak the command word again to release it. Doing so, or missing with the attack, causes the bands to contract and become a sphere once more.\nA creature, including the one restrained, can use an action to make a DC 20 Strength check to break the iron bands. On a success, the item is destroyed, and the restrained creature is freed. If the check fails, any further attempts made by that creature automatically fail until 24 hours have elapsed.\nOnce the bands are used, they can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nIron Flask\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis iron bottle has a brass stopper. You can use an action to speak the flask’s command word, targeting a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target is native to a plane of existence other than the one you’re on, the target must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be trapped in the flask. If the target has been trapped by the flask before, it has advantage on the saving throw. Once trapped, a creature remains in the flask until released. The flask can hold only one creature at a time. A creature trapped in the flask doesn’t need to breathe, eat, or drink and doesn’t age.\nYou can use an action to remove the flask’s stopper and release the creature the flask contains. The creature is friendly to you and your companions for 1 hour and obeys your commands for that duration. If you give no commands or give it a command that is likely to result in its death, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. At the end of the duration, the creature acts in accordance with its normal disposition and alignment.\nAn identify spell reveals that a creature is inside the flask, but the only way to determine the type of creature is to open the flask. A newly discovered bottle might already contain a creature chosen by the GM or determined randomly.\nd100\nContents\n1–50\nEmpty\n51–54\nDemon (type 1)\n55–58\nDemon (type 2)\n59–62\nDemon (type 3)\n63–64\nDemon (type 4)\n65\nDemon (type 5)\n66\nDemon (type 6)\n67\nDeva\n68–69\nDevil (greater)\n70–73\nDevil (lesser)\n74–75\nDjinni\n76–77\nEfreeti\n78–83\nElemental (any)\n84–86\nInvisible stalker\n87–90\nNight hag\n91\nPlanetar\n92–95\nSalamander\n96\nSolar\n97–99\nSuccubus/incubus\n100\nXorn\nJavelin of Lightning\nWeapon (javelin), uncommon\nThis javelin is a magic weapon. When you hurl it and speak its command word, it transforms into a bolt of lightning, forming a line 5 feet wide that extends out from you to a target within 120 feet. Each creature in the line excluding you and the target must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d6 lightning damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The lightning bolt turns back into a javelin when it reaches the target. Make a ranged weapon attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes damage from the javelin plus 4d6 lightning damage.\nThe javelin’s property can’t be used again until the next dawn. In the meantime, the javelin can still be used as a magic weapon.\nLantern of Revealing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nWhile lit, this hooded lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil, shedding bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the lantern’s bright light. You can use an action to lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.\nLuck Blade\nWeapon (any sword), legendary (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. While the sword is on your person, you also gain a +1 bonus to saving throws.\nLuck. If the sword is on your person, you can call on its luck (no action required) to reroll one attack roll, ability check, or saving throw you dislike. You must use the second roll. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nWish. The sword has 1d4 – 1 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge and cast the wish spell from it. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn. The sword loses this property if it has no charges.\nMace of Disruption\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra 2d6 radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes frightened of you until the end of your next turn.\nWhile you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.\nMace of Smiting\nWeapon (mace), rare\nYou gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. The bonus increases to +3 when you use the mace to attack a construct.\nWhen you roll a 20 on an attack roll made with this weapon, the target takes an extra 2d6 bludgeoning damage, or 4d6 bludgeoning damage if it’s a construct. If a construct has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it is destroyed.\nMace of Terror\nWeapon (mace), rare (requires attunement)\nThis magic weapon has 3 charges. While holding it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to release a wave of terror. Each creature of your choice in a 30-foot radius extending from you must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. While it is frightened in this way, a creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If it has nowhere it can move, the creature can use the Dodge action. At the end of each of its turns, a creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success.\nThe mace regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMantle of Spell Resistance\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement)\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells while you wear this cloak.\nManual of Bodily Health\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains health and diet tips, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Constitution score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nManual of Gainful Exercise\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book describes fitness exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Strength score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nManual of Golems\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis tome contains information and incantations necessary to make a particular type of golem. The GM chooses the type or determines it randomly. To decipher and use the manual, you must be a spellcaster with at least two 5th-level spell slots. A creature that can’t use a manual of golems and attempts to read it takes 6d6 psychic damage.\nd20\nGolem\nTime\nCost\n1–5\nClay\n30 days\n65,000 gp\n6–17\nFlesh\n60 days\n50,000 gp\n18\nIron\n120 days\n100,000 gp\n19–20\nStone\n90 days\n80,000 gp\nTo create a golem, you must spend the time shown on the table, working without interruption with the manual at hand and resting no more than 8 hours per day. You must also pay the specified cost to purchase supplies.\nOnce you finish creating the golem, the book is consumed in eldritch flames. The golem becomes animate when the ashes of the manual are sprinkled on it. It is under your control, and it understands and obeys your spoken commands.\nManual of Quickness of Action\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains coordination and balance exercises, and its words are charged with magic. If you spend 48 hours over a period of 6 days or fewer studying the book’s contents and practicing its guidelines, your Dexterity score increases by 2, as does your maximum for that score. The manual then loses its magic, but regains it in a century.\nMarvelous Pigments\nWondrous item, very rare\nTypically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.\nEach pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features—such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons— that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.\nWhen you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.\nNothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.\nIf you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.\nMedallion of Thoughts\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nThe medallion has 3 charges. While wearing it, you can use an action and expend 1 charge to cast the detect thoughts spell (save DC 13) from it. The medallion regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nMirror of Life Trapping\nWondrous item, very rare\nWhen this 4-foot-tall mirror is viewed indirectly, its surface shows faint images of creatures. The mirror weighs 50 pounds, and it has AC 11, 10 hit points, and vulnerability to bludgeoning damage. It shatters and is destroyed when reduced to 0 hit points.\nIf the mirror is hanging on a vertical surface and you are within 5 feet of it, you can use an action to speak its command word and activate it. It remains activated until you use an action to speak the command word again.\nAny creature other than you that sees its reflection in the activated mirror while within 30 feet of it must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw or be trapped, along with anything it is wearing or carrying, in one of the mirror’s twelve extradimensional cells. This saving throw is made with advantage if the creature knows the mirror’s nature, and constructs succeed on the saving throw automatically.\nAn extradimensional cell is an infinite expanse filled with thick fog that reduces visibility to 10 feet. Creatures trapped in the mirror’s cells don’t age, and they don’t need to eat, drink, or sleep. A creature trapped within a cell can escape using magic that permits planar travel. Otherwise, the creature is confined to the cell until freed.\nIf the mirror traps a creature but its twelve extradimensional cells are already occupied, the mirror frees one trapped creature at random to accommodate the new prisoner. A freed creature appears in an unoccupied space within sight of the mirror but facing away from it. If the mirror is shattered, all creatures it contains are freed and appear in unoccupied spaces near it.\nWhile within 5 feet of the mirror, you can use an action to speak the name of one creature trapped in it or call out a particular cell by number. The creature named or contained in the named cell appears as an image on the mirror’s surface. You and the creature can then communicate normally.\nIn a similar way, you can use an action to speak a second command word and free one creature trapped in the mirror. The freed creature appears, along with its possessions, in the unoccupied space nearest to the mirror and facing away from it.\nMithral Armor\nArmor (medium or heavy, but not hide), uncommon\nMithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn’t.\nNecklace of Adaptation\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as cloudkill and stinking cloud effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).\nNecklace of Fireballs\nWondrous item, rare\nThis necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it. You can use an action to detach a bead and throw it up to 60 feet away. When it reaches the end of its trajectory, the bead detonates as a 3rd-level fireball spell (save DC 15).\nYou can hurl multiple beads, or even the whole necklace, as one action. When you do so, increase the level of the fireball by 1 for each bead beyond the first.\nNecklace of Prayer Beads\nWondrous item, rare (requires attunement by a cleric, druid, or paladin)\nThis necklace has 1d4 + 2 magic beads made from aquamarine, black pearl, or topaz. It also has many nonmagical beads made from stones such as amber, bloodstone, citrine, coral, jade, pearl, or quartz. If a magic bead is removed from the necklace, that bead loses its magic.\nSix types of magic beads exist. The GM decides the type of each bead on the necklace or determines it randomly. A necklace can have more than one bead of the same type. To use one, you must be wearing the necklace. Each bead contains a spell that you can cast from it as a bonus action (using your spell save DC if a save is necessary). Once a magic bead’s spell is cast, that bead can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nd20\nBead of …\nSpell\n1–6\nBlessing\nBless\n7–12\nCuring\nCure wounds (2nd level) or lesser restoration\n13–16\nFavor\nGreater restoration\n17–18\nSmiting\nBranding smite\n19\nSummons\nPlanar ally\n20\nWind walking\nWind walk\nNine Lives Stealer\nWeapon (any sword), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.\nThe sword has 1d8 + 1 charges. If you score a critical hit against a creature that has fewer than 100 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be slain instantly as the sword tears its life force from its body (a construct or an undead is immune). The sword loses 1 charge if the creature is slain. When the sword has no charges remaining, it loses this property.\nOathbow\nWeapon (longbow), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhen you nock an arrow on this bow, it whispers in Elvish, Swift defeat to my enemies. When you use this weapon to make a ranged attack, you can, as a command phrase, say, Swift death to you who have wronged me. The target of your attack becomes your sworn enemy until it dies or until dawn seven days later. You can have only one such sworn enemy at a time. When your sworn enemy dies, you can choose a new one after the next dawn.\nWhen you make a ranged attack roll with this weapon against your sworn enemy, you have advantage on the roll. In addition, your target gains no benefit from cover, other than total cover, and you suffer no disadvantage due to long range. If the attack hits, your sworn enemy takes an extra 3d6 piercing damage.\nWhile your sworn enemy lives, you have disadvantage on attack rolls with all other weapons.\nOil of Etherealness\nPotion, rare\nBeads of this cloudy gray oil form on the outside of its container and quickly evaporate.

Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of the etherealness spell for 1 hour.\nOil of Sharpness\nPotion, very rare\nThis clear, gelatinous oil sparkles with tiny, ultrathin silver shards. The oil can coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to 5 pieces of slashing or piercing ammunition. Applying the oil takes 1 minute. For 1 hour, the coated item is magical and has a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls.\nOil of Slipperiness\nPotion, uncommon\nThis sticky black unguent is thick and heavy in the container, but it flows quickly when poured. The oil can cover a Medium or smaller creature, along with the equipment it’s wearing and carrying (one additional vial is required for each size category above Medium). Applying the oil takes 10 minutes. The affected creature then gains the effect of a freedom of movement spell for 8 hours.\nAlternatively, the oil can be poured on the ground as an action, where it covers a 10-foot square, duplicating the effect of the grease spell in that area for 8 hours.\nPearl of Power\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement by a spellcaster)\nWhile this pearl is on your person, you can use an action to speak its command word and regain one expended spell slot.

This potion’s rose-hued, effervescent liquid contains one easy-to-miss bubble shaped like a heart.\nPipes of Haunting\nWondrous item, uncommon\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. They have 3 charges. You can use an action to play them and expend 1 charge to create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Each creature within 30 feet of you that hears you play must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened of you for 1 minute. If you wish, all creatures in the area that aren’t hostile toward you automatically succeed on the saving throw. A creature that fails the saving throw can repeat it at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw is immune to the effect of these pipes for 24 hours. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nPipes of the Sewers\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nYou must be proficient with wind instruments to use these pipes. While you are attuned to the pipes, ordinary rats and giant rats are indifferent toward you and will not attack you unless you threaten or harm them.\nThe pipes have 3 charges. If you play the pipes as an action, you can use a bonus action to expend 1 to 3 charges, calling forth one swarm of rats with each expended charge, provided that enough rats are within half a mile of you to be called in this fashion (as determined by the GM). If there aren’t enough rats to form a swarm, the charge is wasted. Called swarms move toward the music by the shortest available route but aren’t under your control otherwise. The pipes regain 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.\nWhenever a swarm of rats that isn’t under another creature’s control comes within 30 feet of you while you are playing the pipes, you can make a Charisma check contested by the swarm’s Wisdom check. If you lose the contest, the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours. If you win the contest, the swarm is swayed by the pipes’ music and becomes friendly to you and your companions for as long as you continue to play the pipes each round as an action. A friendly swarm obeys your commands. If you issue no commands to a friendly swarm, it defends itself but otherwise takes no actions. If a friendly swarm starts its turn and can’t hear the pipes’ music, your control over that swarm ends, and the swarm behaves as it normally would and can’t be swayed by the pipes’ music for the next 24 hours.\nPlate Armor of Etherealness\nArmor (plate), legendary (requires attunement)\nWhile you’re wearing this armor, you can speak its command word as an action to gain the effect of the etherealness spell, which last for 10 minutes or until you remove the armor or use an action to speak the command word again. This property of the armor can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nPortable Hole\nWondrous item, rare\nThis fine black cloth, soft as silk, is folded up to the dimensions of a handkerchief. It unfolds into a circular sheet 6 feet in diameter.\nYou can use an action to unfold a portable hole and place it on or against a solid surface, whereupon the portable hole creates an extradimensional hole 10 feet deep. The cylindrical space within the hole exists on a different plane, so it can’t be used to create open passages. Any creature inside an open portable hole can exit the hole by climbing out of it.\nYou can use an action to close a portable hole by taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Folding the cloth closes the hole, and any creatures or objects within remain in the extradimensional space. No matter what’s in it, the hole weighs next to nothing.\nIf the hole is folded up, a creature within the hole’s extradimensional space can use an action to make a DC 10 Strength check. On a successful check, the creature forces its way out and appears within 5 feet of the portable hole or the creature carrying it. A breathing creature within a closed portable hole can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate.\nPlacing a portable hole inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can’t be reopened.\nPotion of Animal Friendship\nPotion, uncommon\nWhen you drink this potion, you can cast the animal friendship spell (save DC 13) for 1 hour at will.

Shaking the bottle fails to interrupt this process.\nPotion of Healing\nPotion, rarity varies\nYou regain hit points when you drink this potion.

However, it is actually poison masked by illusion magic. An identify spell reveals its true nature.\nIf you drink it, you take 3d6 poison damage, and you must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned. At the start of each of your turns while you are poisoned in this way, you take 3d6 poison damage. At the end of each of your turns, you can repeat the saving throw.

The absorbed spell’s effect is canceled, and the spell’s energy—not the spell itself—is stored in the rod. The energy has the same level as the spell when it was cast. The rod can absorb and store up to 50 levels of energy over the course of its existence. Once the rod absorbs 50 levels of energy, it can’t absorb more. If you are targeted by a spell that the rod can’t store, the rod has no effect on that spell.\nWhen you become attuned to the rod, you know how many levels of energy the rod has absorbed over the course of its existence, and how many levels of spell energy it currently has stored.\nIf you are a spellcaster holding the rod, you can convert energy stored in it into spell slots to cast spells you have prepared or know. You can create spell slots only of a level equal to or lower than your own spell slots, up to a maximum of 5th level. You use the stored levels in place of your slots, but otherwise cast the spell as normal. For example, you can use 3 levels stored in the rod as a 3rd-level spell slot.\nA newly found rod has 1d10 levels of spell energy stored in it already. A rod that can no longer absorb spell energy and has no energy remaining becomes nonmagical.\nRod of Alertness\nRod, very rare (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head and the following properties.\nAlertness. While holding the rod, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks and on rolls for initiative.\nSpells. While holding the rod, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: detect evil and good, detect magic, detect poison and disease, or see invisibility.\nProtective Aura. As an action, you can plant the haft end of the rod in the ground, whereupon the rod’s head sheds bright light in a 60-foot radius and dim light for an additional 60 feet. While in that bright light, you and any creature that is friendly to you gain a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws and can sense the location of any invisible hostile creature that is also in the bright light.\nThe rod’s head stops glowing and the effect ends after 10 minutes, or when a creature uses an action to pull the rod from the ground. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Lordly Might\nRod, legendary (requires attunement)\nThis rod has a flanged head, and it functions as a magic mace that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.\nSix Buttons. You can press one of the rod’s six buttons as a bonus action. A button’s effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 1, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod’s flanged head.\nIf you press button 2, the rod’s flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 3, the rod’s flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod’s tip, and the rod’s handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.\nIf you press button 4, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.\nIf you press button 5, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.\nIf you press button 6, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.\nDrain Life. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nParalyze. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nTerrify. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. This property can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Rulership\nRod, rare (requires attunement)\nYou can use an action to present the rod and command obedience from each creature of your choice that you can see within 120 feet of you. Each target must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for 8 hours. While charmed in this way, the creature regards you as its trusted leader. If harmed by you or your companions, or commanded to do something contrary to its nature, a target ceases to be charmed in this way. The rod can’t be used again until the next dawn.\nRod of Security\nRod, very rare\nWhile holding this rod, you can use an action to activate it. The rod then instantly transports you and up to 199 other willing creatures you can see to a paradise that exists in an extraplanar space. You choose the form that the paradise takes. It could be a tranquil garden, lovely glade, cheery tavern, immense palace, tropical island, fantastic carnival, or whatever else you can imagine. Regardless of its nature, the paradise contains enough water and food to sustain its visitors. Everything else that can be interacted with inside the extraplanar space can exist only there. For example, a flower picked from a garden in the paradise disappears if it is taken outside the extraplanar space.\nFor each hour spent in the paradise, a visitor regains hit points as if it had spent 1 Hit Die. Also, creatures don’t age while in the paradise, although time passes normally. Visitors can remain in the paradise for up to 200 days divided by the number of creatures present (round down).\nWhen the time runs out or you use an action to end it, all visitors reappear in the location they occupied when you activated the rod, or an unoccupied space nearest that location. The rod can’t be used again until ten days have passed.\nRope of Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon\nThis 60-foot length of silk rope weighs 3 pounds and can hold up to 3,000 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak the command word, the rope animates. As a bonus action, you can command the other end to move toward a destination you choose. That end moves 10 feet on your turn when you first command it and 10 feet on each of your turns until reaching its destination, up to its maximum length away, or until you tell it to stop. You can also tell the rope to fasten itself securely to an object or to unfasten itself, to knot or unknot itself, or to coil itself for carrying.\nIf you tell the rope to knot, large knots appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. While knotted, the rope shortens to a 50-foot length and grants advantage on checks made to climb it.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\nRope of Entanglement\nWondrous item, rare\nThis rope is 30 feet long and weighs 3 pounds. If you hold one end of the rope and use an action to speak its command word, the other end darts forward to entangle a creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or become restrained.\nYou can release the creature by using a bonus action to speak a second command word. A target restrained by the rope can use an action to make a DC 15 Strength or Dexterity check (target’s choice). On a success, the creature is no longer restrained by the rope.\nThe rope has AC 20 and 20 hit points. It regains 1 hit point every 5 minutes as long as it has at least 1 hit point. If the rope drops to 0 hit points, it is destroyed.\nScarab of Protection\nWondrous item, legendary (requires attunement)\nIf you hold this beetle-shaped medallion in your hand for 1 round, an inscription appears on its surface revealing its magical nature. It provides two benefits while it is on your person:\nYou have advantage on saving throws against spells.\nThe scarab has 12 charges. If you fail a saving throw against a necromancy spell or a harmful effect originating from an undead creature, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and turn the failed save into a successful one. The scarab crumbles into powder and is destroyed when its last charge is expended.\nScimitar of Speed\nWeapon (scimitar), very rare (requires attunement)\nYou gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.\nShield of Missile Attraction\nArmor (shield), rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have resistance to damage from ranged weapon attacks.\nCurse. This shield is cursed. Attuning to it curses you until you are targeted by the remove curse spell or similar magic. Removing the shield fails to end the curse on you. Whenever a ranged weapon attack is made against a target within 10 feet of you, the curse causes you to become the target instead.\nSlippers of Spider Climbing\nWondrous item, uncommon (requires attunement)\nWhile you wear these light shoes, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. However, the slippers don’t allow you to move this way on a slippery surface, such as one covered by ice or oil.\nSovereign Glue\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis viscous, milky-white substance can form a permanent adhesive bond between any two objects. It must be stored in a jar or flask that has been coated inside with oil of slipperiness. When found, a container contains 1d6 + 1 ounces.\nOne ounce of the glue can cover a 1-foot square surface. The glue takes 1 minute to set. Once it has done so, the bond it creates can be broken only by the application of universal solvent or oil of etherealness, or with a wish spell.\nSpell Scroll\nScroll, varies\nA spell scroll bears the words of a single spell, written in a mystical cipher. If the spell is on your class’s spell list, you can use an action to read the scroll and cast its spell without having to provide any of the spell’s components. Otherwise, the scroll is unintelligible.\nIf the spell is on your class’s spell list but of a higher level than you can normally cast, you must make an ability check using your spellcasting ability to determine whether you cast it successfully. The DC equals 10 + the spell’s level. On a failed check, the spell disappears from the scroll with no other effect.\nOnce the spell is cast, the words on the scroll fade, and the scroll itself crumbles to dust.\nThe level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell’s saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll’s rarity, as shown in the Spell Scroll table.\nSpell Scroll\nSpell Level\nRarity\nSave DC\nAttack Bonus\nCantrip\nCommon\n13\n+5\n1st\nCommon\n13\n+5\n2nd\nUncommon\n13\n+5\n3rd\nUncommon\n15\n+7\n4th\nRare\n15\n+7\n5th\nRare\n17\n+9\n6th\nVery rare\n17\n+9\n7th\nVery rare\n18\n+10\n8th\nVery rare\n18\n+10\n9th\nLegendary\n19\n+11\nA wizard spell on a spell scroll can be copied just as spells in spellbooks can be copied. When a spell is copied from a spell scroll, the copier must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check with a DC equal to 10 + the spell’s level. If the check succeeds, the spell is successfully copied. Whether the check succeeds or fails, the spell scroll is destroyed.\nSpellguard Shield\nArmor (shield), very rare (requires attunement)\nWhile holding this shield, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects, and spell attacks have disadvantage against you.\nSphere of Annihilation\nWondrous item, legendary\nThis 2-foot-diameter black sphere is a hole in the multiverse, hovering in space and stabilized by a magical field surrounding it.\nThe sphere obliterates all matter it passes through and all matter that passes through it. Artifacts are the exception. Unless an artifact is susceptible to damage from a sphere of annihilation, it passes through the sphere unscathed. Anything else that touches the sphere but isn’t wholly engulfed and obliterated by it takes 4d10 force damage.\nThe sphere is stationary until someone controls it. If you are within 60 feet of an uncontrolled sphere, you can use an action to make a DC 25 Intelligence (Arcana) check. On a success, the sphere levitates in one direction of your choice, up to a number of feet equal to 5 × your Intelligence modifier (minimum 5 feet). On a failure, the sphere moves 10 feet toward you. A creature whose space the sphere enters must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or be touched by it, taking 4d10 force damage.\nIf you attempt to control a sphere that is under another creature’s control, you make an Intelligence (Arcana) check contested by the other creature’s Intelligence (Arcana) check. The winner of the contest gains control of the sphere and can levitate it as normal.\nIf the sphere comes into contact with a planar portal, such as that created by the gate spell, or an extradimensional space, such as that within a portable hole, the GM determines randomly what happens, using the following table.\nd100\nResult\n01–50\nThe sphere is destroyed.\n51–85\nThe sphere moves through the portal or into the extradimensional space.\n86–00\nA spatial rift sends each creature and object within 180 feet of the sphere, including the sphere, to a random plane of existence.\nStaff of Charming\nStaff, rare (requires attunement by a bard, cleric, druid, sorcerer, warlock, or wizard)\nWhile holding this staff, you can use an action to expend 1 of its 10 charges to cast charm person, command, or comprehend languages from it using your spell save DC.

You can’t use this property of the staff again until the next dawn. If you succeed on a save against an enchantment spell that targets only you, with or without the staff’s intervention, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge from the staff and turn the spell back on its caster as if you had cast the spell.

A creature that is neither good nor evil in alignment takes 6d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. A good creature takes 8d6 necrotic damage upon touching the talisman. Either sort of creature takes the damage again each time it ends its turn holding or carrying the talisman.\nIf you are an evil cleric or paladin, you can use the talisman as a holy symbol, and you gain a +2 bonus to spell attack rolls while you wear or hold it.\nThe talisman has 6 charges. If you are wearing or holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 charge from the talisman and choose one creature you can see on the ground within 120 feet of you. If the target is of good alignment, a flaming fissure opens under it. The target must succeed on a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw or fall into the fissure and be destroyed, leaving no remains. The fissure then closes, leaving no trace of its existence. When you expend the last charge, the talisman dissolves into foul-smelling slime and is destroyed.\nTome of Clear Thought\nWondrous item, very rare\nThis book contains memory and logic exercises, and its words are charged with magic.

The creature dies if it can’t survive without the lost head. A creature is immune to this effect if it is immune to slashing damage, doesn’t have or need a head, has legendary actions, or the GM decides that the creature is too big for its head to be cut off with this weapon. Such a creature instead takes an extra 6d8 slashing damage from the hit.\nWand of Binding\nWand, rare (requires attunement by a spellcaster)\nThis wand has 7 charges for the following properties.

It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving.

You can use the boots to fly for up to 4 hours, all at once or in several shorter flights, each one using a minimum of 1 minute from the duration.

This turns the cloak into a pair of bat wings or bird wings on your back for 1 hour or until you repeat the command word as an action. The wings give you a flying speed of 60 feet. When they disappear, you can’t use them again for 1d12 hours."

    "text": "Sentient Magic Items\nSentient Magic Items\nSome magic items possess sentience and personality. Such an item might be possessed, haunted by the spirit of a previous owner, or self-aware thanks to the magic used to create it. In any case, the item behaves like a character, complete with personality quirks, ideals, bonds, and sometimes flaws. A sentient item might be a cherished ally to its wielder or a continual thorn in the side.\nMost sentient items are weapons. Other kinds of items can manifest sentience, but consumable items such as potions and scrolls are never sentient.\nSentient magic items function as NPCs under the GM’s control. Any activated property of the item is under the item’s control, not its wielder’s. As long as the wielder maintains a good relationship with the item, the wielder can access those properties normally. If the relationship is strained, the item can suppress its activated properties or even turn them against the wielder.\nCreating Sentient Magic Items\nWhen you decide to make a magic item sentient, you create the item’s persona in the same way you would create an NPC, with a few exceptions described here.\nAbilities\nA sentient magic item has Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You can choose the item’s abilities or determine them randomly. To determine them randomly, roll 4d6 for each one, dropping the lowest roll and totaling the rest.\nCommunication\nA sentient item has some ability to communicate, either by sharing its emotions, broadcasting its thoughts telepathically, or speaking aloud. You can choose how it communicates or roll on the following table.\nd100\nCommunication\n01–60\nThe item communicates by transmitting emotion to the creature carrying or wielding it.\n61–90\nThe item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages.\n91–00\nThe item can speak, read, and understand one or more languages. In addition, the item can communicate telepathically with any character that carries or wields it.\nSenses\nWith sentience comes awareness. A sentient item can perceive its surroundings out to a limited range. You can choose its senses or roll on the following table.\nd4\nSenses\n1\nHearing and normal vision out to 30 feet.\n2\nHearing and normal vision out to 60 feet\n3\nHearing and normal vision out to 120 feet.\n4\nHearing and darkvision out to 120 feet.\nAlignment\nA sentient magic item has an alignment. Its creator or nature might suggest an alignment. If not, you can pick an alignment or roll on the following table.\nd100\nAlignment\n01–15\nLawful good\n16–35\nNeutral good\n36–50\nChaotic good\n51–63\nLawful neutral\n64–73\nNeutral\n74–85\nChaotic neutral\n86–89\nLawful evil\n90–96\nNeutral evil\n97–00\nChaotic evil\nSpecial Purpose\nYou can give a sentient item an objective it pursues, perhaps to the exclusion of all else. As long as the wielder’s use of the item aligns with that special purpose, the item remains cooperative. Deviating from this course might cause conflict between the wielder and the item, and could even cause the item to prevent the use of its activated properties. You can pick a special purpose or roll on the following table.\nd10\nPurpose\n1\nAligned: The item seeks to defeat or destroy those of a diametrically opposed alignment. (Such an item is never neutral.)\n2\nBane: The item seeks to defeat or destroy creatures of a particular kind, such as fiends, shapechangers, trolls, or wizards.\n3\nProtector: The item seeks to defend a particular race or kind of creature, such as elves or druids.\n4\nCrusader: The item seeks to defeat, weaken, or destroy the servants of a particular deity.\n5\nTemplar: The item seeks to defend the servants and interests of a particular deity.\n6\nDestroyer: The item craves destruction and goads its user to fight arbitrarily.\n7\nGlory Seeker: The item seeks renown as the greatest magic item in the world, by establishing its user as a famous or notorious figure.\n8\nLore Seeker: The item craves knowledge or is determined to solve a mystery, learn a secret, or unravel a cryptic prophecy.\n9\nDestiny Seeker: The item is convinced that it and its wielder have key roles to play in future events.\n10\nCreator Seeker: The item seeks its creator and wants to understand why it was created.\nConflict\nA sentient item has a will of its own, shaped by its personality and alignment. If its wielder acts in a manner opposed to the item’s alignment or purpose, conflict can arise. When such a conflict occurs, the item makes a Charisma check contested by the wielder’s Charisma check. If the item wins the contest, it makes one or more of the following demands:\nThe item insists on being carried or worn at all times.\nThe item demands that its wielder dispose of anything the item finds repugnant.\nThe item demands that its wielder pursue the item’s goals to the exclusion of all other goals.\nThe item demands to be given to someone else.\nIf its wielder refuses to comply with the item’s wishes, the item can do any or all of the following:\nMake it impossible for its wielder to attune to it.\nSuppress one or more of its activated properties.\nAttempt to take control of its wielder.\nIf a sentient item attempts to take control of its wielder, the wielder must make a Charisma saving throw, with a DC equal to 12 + the item’s Charisma modifier. On a failed save, the wielder is charmed by the item for 1d12 hours. While charmed, the wielder must try to follow the item’s commands. If the wielder takes damage, it can repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on a success. Whether the attempt to control its user succeeds or fails, the item can’t use this power again until the next dawn."

    "text": "Artifacts\nArtifacts\nOrb of Dragonkind\nWondrous item, artifact (requires attunement)\nAges past, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb’s depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become charmed by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.\nWhile you are charmed by the orb, you can’t voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts suggestion on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of a dragon deity, or something else the GM decides.\nRandom Properties. An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:\n2 minor beneficial properties\n1 minor detrimental property\n1 major detrimental property\nSpells. The orb has 7 charges and regains 1d4 + 3 expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: cure wounds (5th-level version, 3 charges), daylight (1 charge), death ward (2 charges), or scrying (3 charges).\nYou can also use an action to cast the detect magic spell from the orb without using any charges.\nCall Dragons. While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will. Once you have used this property, it can’t be used again for 1 hour.\nDestroying an Orb. An Orb of Dragonkind appears fragile but is impervious to most damage, including the attacks and breath weapons of dragons. A disintegrate spell or one good hit from a +3 magic weapon is sufficient to destroy an orb, however."
